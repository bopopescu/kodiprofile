[B]Version 0.3.2[/B]
- Slight Adjustments made to the Download Function(s).
- Along with Genre(Select), the OldMenu feature now provides a method to view the Last... stuff in a submenu in order to work around any issues with refreshing the main menu when ran from a shortcut on the MainScreen of XBMC.
- Check out Settings for a Genre and All|#|A-Z Style changer to change the graphics for the 2 folder listings.  At this moment it looked like some links with -'s were having problems so some icons for 'ALL' don't seem to want to show up.  Please go easy on switching between these as to not bombard the remote hosts.
- Ability to Add a Favorite from one folder to another... Thus allowing you to move them... for now you still have to click remove after you click add if you dont want to keep it there too.
- More Code Cleanup.
- Main-Menu tab added to Addon/Plugin Settings Window/Dialog since there was getting to be quite a bit in the General tab.

### Due to this, I'm converting the select menus to folder menus.
### Finding out that the select sort method select screen list has a problem of showing up again cause of some darn refreshing issue.
- Working on setting up a normal genre folder listing with the select sort method system.

[B]Version 0.3.1[/B]

- A little note for viewing Manga... "o": Picture Information, "r": Rotate, "<-" (left arrow key): previous picture, "->" (right arrow key): next picture, 0-9: Zoom (arrow keys can move you around).  These are features of XBMC.
- More Stuff done in listEpisode().  Label name parsing, Date information and Plot filled with misc info for easy viewing.

- After a few seconds thought I did go ahead and add in an option in the Settings Window for having the old style method displayed as well.
- Old items on the MainMenu Removed/Hidden for genre/sortmethod folder list instead of the new select list.  Let me know if there's any interest in putting those back in, with a setting option to display them or not.
- Favorites Folder No. 3 and 4 have been added.  Remember that you can customize their names in the Settings Menu.
- _DoGetItems(), Select_AZ(), Select_Sort(), Select_Genre() added for the new choice list(s) method.  You can now choose All, Numbers (0-9), or A-Z for the Anime List.
