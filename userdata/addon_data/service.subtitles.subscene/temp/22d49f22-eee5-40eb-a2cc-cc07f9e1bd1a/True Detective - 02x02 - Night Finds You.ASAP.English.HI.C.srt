How'd a water stain get there?

38
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:56,126
It rained maybe twice
this last year.

39
00:01:57,663 --> 00:01:59,630
It's like everything's
papier-mÃ¢ché.

40
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:05,336
Stop thinking.

41
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,672
I don't like being on a ledge.

42
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:11,875
Nobody gets rich
on their own money.

43
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:15,112
I never really knew
what to do with it.

44
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:18,682
Money.

45
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:22,319
<i>I see that about myself.</i>

46
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:29,326
You always said
you want lots of land.

47
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:31,628
Yes,

48
00:02:31,962 --> 00:02:33,996
but you need children
to leave it to.

49
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,867
It's never really yours.

50
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,336
You don't take it with you.

51
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,038
Jordan: <i>You don't take
anything with you.</i>

52
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,708
Just yourself,
whatever that was.

53
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:49,879
I've worked my whole
life, same as you.

54
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:53,549
And not being poor is
better than the opposite.

55
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:01,223
My old man back in Chicago,

56
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:04,360
when I was a kid...
( chuckles )

57
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:07,663
he used to lock me in the basement
when he'd go on a bender.

58
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,066
Usually last the night.

59
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:13,302
Let me out the next day.

60
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,836
Thought he was keeping
me safe, I guess.

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,341
This one time, I was six...

62
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:24,078
he puts me down there

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,781
and I wake up

64
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,584
and it's locked.

65
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:31,952
It had happened before.

66
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,024
Anyways, I guess
he ended up arrested.

67
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:38,225
I guess.

68
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,927
God, baby.

69
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,496
( chuckles ) Well...

70
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,731
by the second morning...

71
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:48,134
I was out of food.

72
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:53,407
The third day,
the lightbulb burned out.

73
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,043
Pitch-black in there.

74
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:01,281
That's when the rats
started coming out.

75
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:05,150
I dozed off and...

76
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,456
I felt the thing, you know,
nibbling my finger.

77
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,631
I woke up.

78
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:21,466
It was, you know,
chewing my finger.

79
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:26,304
What did you do?

80
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:29,273
I grabbed it in the dark
with my hands

81
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,275
and I started smashing it.

82
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:35,313
And I just kept smashing it...

83
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,850
till it was nothing
but goo in my hands.

84
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,126
Two more days I was in there...

85
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:53,263
in the dark...

86
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,467
till my dad comes home.

87
00:05:09,513 --> 00:05:12,848
Sometimes I wonder how many
things you have like that...

88
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:17,819
that I don't know about.

89
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:21,155
Ever since, I wondered

90
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:23,692
what if he never comes home?

91
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:29,898
What if I'm...

92
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:35,436
still in that basement

93
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:37,138
in the dark?

94
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,915
What if I died there?

95
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:58,726
That's what that reminds me of.

96
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:00,561
<i>What?</i>

97
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,264
That water stain.

98
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,838
Something's trying
to tell me that

99
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,073
it's all papier-mÃ¢ché.

100
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,010
Something's telling me
to wake up.

101
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,880
Like...

102
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,920
like I'm not real.

103
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,057
<i>Like I'm only dreaming.</i>

104
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:39,431
TOD between 4:00 and 9:00 AM
morning of the 26th.

105
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:42,400
Tox shows Xanax, alcohol,

106
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:45,437
also had gonorrhea,
for what it's worth.

107
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:47,339
Hydrochloric acid on his eyes.

108
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,841
Burn pattern tells us
he was on his back.

109
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,476
Lack of spray around
the orbital cavity

110
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,844
indicates precision.

111
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:55,613
Some kind of glass
eyedropper, maybe.

112
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,414
He's our body.

113
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,250
I don't see that changing, so
why don't you all fill me in?

114
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,753
Victim is a key figure
in a state's investigation.

115
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:04,889
- What state investigation?
Geldof: <i>- Newly formed.</i>

116
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,791
We're looking into
various allegations

117
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,492
made against Vinci
in the papers.

118
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:12,362
Vinci detectives have been on Caspere
as a missing person for two days.

119
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,065
We have the man's house
which was burglarized.

120
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,533
<i>You want to shut us out,</i>

121
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:18,835
<i>we'll continue our
investigation autonomously.</i>

122
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,172
In Vinci, so everybody can keep
their little corners to themselves,

123
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,442
but, ladies and gentlemen,
PD is solving this case.

124
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:29,746
I understand Ventura. How does
the state have any claim here?

125
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,882
Our officer found the body.

126
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:35,919
Davis: <i>This could get you out from under, Woodrugh.
That actress bullshit.</i>

127
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:37,687
You'd be detailed
as a state's investigator.

128
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:40,724
Geldof: <i>The Caspere homicide
is your public investigation.</i>

129
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,159
<i>Looking into Vinci PD</i>
<i>is your confidential mandate.</i>

130
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,761
Gathering intel
for a grand jury.

131
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:48,731
This probe is very important
to the governor's office.

132
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,600
Say this goes your way.

133
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,935
How's it play for my boy
here once the dust settles?

134
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:55,204
Everything shakes out,

135
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,940
you'll be offered a chance
to remain investigator.

136
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:00,175
In line for a state
detective shield.

137
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:03,045
<i>We can wipe away</i>
<i>all that admin hassle.</i>

138
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,548
When this is over,

139
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,785
can I just go back
to being on the bike?

140
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:12,855
Coroner: <i>You can see abrasions
on his wrists and ankles,</i>

141
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:14,990
lividity on his torso.

142
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:17,725
He was bound upside down.

143
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,195
<i>Or close to it.</i>

144
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:22,531
O'Neal: <i>Attorney general's
office has concerns</i>

145
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:24,866
about obfuscation
on the part of Vinci PD.

146
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:27,735
Davis: <i>Detective Bezzerides, you'll
be primary commander of the detail.</i>

147
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:30,272
Secondary is gonna be
a Vinci guy, Velcoro.

148
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:32,807
Your DB was into
a lot of LA County money.

149
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:36,010
His house was broken into,
so you're going to Vinci.

150
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:38,379
Vinci detective with you,
word is he's bent.

151
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:41,115
Work him. Leverage
something to turn him.

152
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,217
We'll have a full state
probe up inside a week.

153
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:45,953
Caspere's death is a window
into everything.

154
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:48,156
And what is everything exactly?

155
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,090
You know anything
about the city of Vinci?

156
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:54,961
( whooping )

157
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:59,032
Davis: <i>It started out as a
vice haven early 1900s.</i>

158
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:01,669
<i>Went industrial in the '20s.</i>

159
00:09:02,036 --> 00:09:04,805
<i>Pushed out residents</i>
<i>from manufacturing zones.</i>

160
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:09,442
<i>Worse air polluter</i>

to stop my grandfather</i>

163
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:22,522
<i>from industrial rezoning.</i>

164
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:25,625
<i>Same thing.</i>

165
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,128
<i>Geldof's been after us since
we won the last EPA suit.</i>

166
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:32,298
It's about money,
Detective Velcoro.

167
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,499
Bodine: <i>Caspere was
one of the architects</i>

168
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:34,900
<i>of the community</i>
<i>renewal initiative.</i>

169
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:37,303
Passing legislature,
our city gets to keep

170
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:41,240
75% of its county tax
revenue for eight years.

171
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:43,308
- And what's that worth?
- <i>About $900 million.</i>

172
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:45,010
Being kept from
the county general fund.

173
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:46,478
Chessani: <i>Hell, Ernst,
it's our money.</i>

174
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,849
Vinci's a goddamn success story
in a depressed economy.

175
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,384
Burns: <i>State's gonna use the homicide
to dig into whatever they can, Ray.</i>

176
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:55,654
Wherever the Caspere case goes,
we need you running point.

177
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:58,724
Control the sprawl. Control
the flow of information.

178
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,727
Dixon is secondary to you
staging out of Vinci.

179
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:05,997
<i>You'll be working under a Ventura
detective commanding the task force.</i>

180
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,469
That clear to you, Detective?

181
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,138
10-4, Lieutenant.
Just one question.

182
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,774
Am I supposed
to solve this or not?

183
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,210
( sniffs )

184
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:21,813
Just no surprises,
Detective Velcoro.

185
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:24,749
Ray accepts dualities
must be effected

186
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:28,653
<i>to serve public interests.</i>

187
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:30,521
I really do.

188
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,492
- Ani: <i>Bound?</i>
<i>Coroner: - Vinyl fabric.</i>

189
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:37,027
You can see the edge of the
buckle's imprint on both wrists.

190
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:38,596
Tape residue.

191
00:10:38,963 --> 00:10:41,532
Pelvic wounds are from a
12-gauge at point-blank range.

192
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:43,967
<i>Some kind</i>
<i>of Super-X heavy load.</i>

193

<i>Came after the eye stuff.</i>
<i>Official COD is heart attack.</i>

194
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,372
- <i>Trauma-induced.</i>
<i>- A coup de grace.</i>

195
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,041
Coroner: <i>Lividity
indicates he was placed</i>

196
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,676
<i>in upright position</i>
<i>after death.</i>

197
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:54,011
<i>Spent a few hours that way.</i>

198
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:56,646
Nothing under his nails,
no prints.

199
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,649
No trace at all?

200
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,794
His eyes? What the fuck kind
of modus operandi is that?

201
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:12,195
Doc said it was
hydrochloric acid.

202
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,131
And a shotgun blast happened.

203
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,967
Torture. Somebody wanted
to know something.

204
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:19,068
Yeah, his house was tossed.

205
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,938
Somebody's making a move.

206
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,874
What?
What does that mean?

207
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,508
You knew Caspere?

208
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,878
There's deals
being done upstate.

209
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:32,114
- A lot of money moving around.
- <i>What deals?</i>

210
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:35,351
- You pull my string? Is that how this works?
- <i>Jesus, Frank.</i>

211
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:37,118
The more I know, the better
I can deal with this.

212
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:38,387
This is what you deal with.

213
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:40,889
Caspere was important to
this thing I have going on.

214
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:42,624
I've got to clean it up now.

215
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:45,394
So you beat the bushes
until you figure it out.

216
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:47,295
You ain't no sheriff's brownie.
You're a detective.

217
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:49,264
Who's your best informant?

218
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:50,698
Are you serious?

219
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:53,335
Fucking hell, Raymond.

Cynthia:
<i>So good to see you.</i>

228
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:49,055
Why don't you visit me more?

229
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:51,458
Just busy.
The job.

230
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:54,761
The job. We haven't
had dinner in ages.

231
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,562
That's why I brought
you this, Ma.

232
00:12:56,897 --> 00:12:58,264
- ( smacks )
- Don't give me that Ma shit.

233
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:00,266
It's too late for us
to start all that now.

234
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,668
Well, you ought
to eat something.

235
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:05,571
Oh, I don't touch bread.

236
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,706
Peel that skin off
for me, Paulie.

237
00:13:10,444 --> 00:13:12,511
So strong.

238
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:17,917
I saw your old prom date
the other day.

239
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:19,785
She got fat.

240
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:21,153
I remember her.

241
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:23,255
Couldn't wait to have
somebody's baby.

242
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:26,559
She was nice.
She was nice to me.

243
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,226
( chuckles )

244
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:31,463
All the girls are nice
to you, Paulie.

245
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:33,898
You haven't figured
that out by now?

246
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,537
Want to stay tonight?

247
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,173
We can watch a Clint movie.

248
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,976
You can have your old room.

249
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:45,944
I'm working on something.

250
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:49,180
- Just came to see--
- Who is she, you scamp?

251
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:52,016
You rake.

252
00:13:52,384 --> 00:13:54,652
You got hound's blood
just like your daddy.

253
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:57,088
I'm not gonna
be around for a while.

254
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:59,491
I've got to work
around LA and the coast.

255
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,261
- Special detail.
- Mm.

256
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:07,264
Then stay.
We can play cards.

257
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:09,233
You can have your old room.

258
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:15,506
You been getting any more shifts
at the restaurant lately?

259
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,243
Not with my carpal tunnel.

260
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:22,679
I'd lose my state check anyway.

261
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,315
I thought Bill was letting
you work off the books.

262
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:28,785
Oh, Bill? Don't talk to me

Damn. I so hate making a mess.

269
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,534
A lot of paperwork, you know.

270
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,503
It messes with you.

00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:31,580
Well, somebody was looking for something.
Would explain the torture.

278

Psychiatrist appointments.

<i>We need to call every
appointment in that calendar.</i>

Not a lot of people do.

288

This place gets

I tried one once. It felt
like it was smoking me.

292

A real cigarette wouldn't
make you feel like that.

293
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:32,471
Maybe it was just
a little too close

294
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:35,708
to sucking a robot's dick.
I don't know.

<i>( machines whirring )</i>

Frank: Caspere was my
bank on this thing.

297
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:55,894
My disposal company
set this up.

298
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:57,896
Chemical runoff.
We took the risk.

299
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:00,666
And that risk afforded you the
chance to buy into the corridor.

300
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,868
But I'm telling you,
that buy was never made.

301
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:05,771
Caspere had me down for 12
parcels below Monterey.

302
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:08,740
Frank, I can only account for
what purchases Caspere completed.

303
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,242
- Are you saying that I--
- Mr. McCandless,

304
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:14,612
Mr. Caspere had effectively
sold Mr. Semyon the land

305
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,748
<i>while acting as a
short-term holding company.</i>

306
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,285
All we're trying to do is
ensure the deal for our parcel

307
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,253
goes through despite
Caspere's tragedy.

308
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,455
If you got this transaction
legally documented,

309
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:26,691
- it shouldn't be hard.
- You know we have issues.

310
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:29,227
If we had a fucking paper trail,
we'd be doing this through banks.

311
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,829
Well, otherwise I'd say you're
in the unenviable position

312
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,531
of being owed money
by a dead man.

313
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:35,533
That's $5 million of my money.

314
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,501
<i>Hold it, we were</i>
<i>given to understand</i>

315
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:39,469
that our partnership
was with Catalast.

316
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:41,572
Had Mr. Caspere made payment,
it would have been.

317
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,608
And your name would have been added to the
corporate charter for the development.

318
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:46,777
- But he didn't.
- How do I know that?

319
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,679
We're not gangsters, Frank.

320
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:50,748
<i>This is unacceptable.</i>

321
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:53,350
Since Caspere's remaining
interests have been voided,

322
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,686
I can provide you the
same parcel, same price.

323
00:17:55,953 --> 00:17:58,188
- Seven million.
- The same?

324
00:17:58,389 --> 00:17:59,423
We were quoted 10.

325
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:00,724
Not by me.

326
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:07,464
Motherfuck.

327
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:09,333
Motherfuck me.

328
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:14,570
We sold off our Vinci assets
to put in with Caspere and...

329
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,742
I went liquid for this deal.

330
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:20,977
What can I tell you, Frank?
It sounds like Mr. Caspere

331
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,812
was playing fast and loose
with your capital.

332
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,781
I can offer you
the buy-in again,

333
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,582
but it sounds
like you're short.

334
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:28,083
I can get it back.

335
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:30,819
Find another stake,
it'd be worth your while.

336
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,688
Excuse me.

337
00:18:38,228 --> 00:18:40,396
Shit.
Seven he says?

338
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:42,498
Seven's the same
as 10 to me at this point.

339
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,666
Can't round off zero.

340
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,742
( sighs )

341
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:57,780
Am I diminished?

342
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,914
Is that my message
to the goddamn--

343
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,488
My business partner
takes my money,

344
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:09,223
gets tortured and murdered,

345
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,726
and what?

346
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:14,796
I'm waiting on this Velcoro
burnout to make like Rockford?

347
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,268
( scoffs )
Get everybody.

348
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:23,871
Stan, Ivar, his cousins,
our Glendale people.

349
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,040
Fucking Blake, wherever
the fuck he's been.

350
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:28,142
Frank, we can look
at your remaining assets.

351
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,878
I don't have
any fucking assets.

352
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:33,714
The house and the poker room
were double mortgaged.

353
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,452
This was fucking everything.

354
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:41,522
That's what you meant.
Frank, why did you--

355
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,957
Leave it.
I'll get it back.

356
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,795
Every dime.

357
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:53,399
That was maybe a month ago.

358
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,202
September.

359
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:58,038
Celebrated breaking ground
on the Red Line extension

360
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:02,876
and the imminent production
of a major Hollywood movie.

361
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,546
Big news for the city.
And Ben had a hand--

362
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,716
Could you tell us anything about
Mr. Caspere's demeanor at the party?

363
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:12,785
Was he with someone?
A date?

364
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:18,825
A woman he had been seeing.

365
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:23,128
I think.

366
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,731
Can't quite recall her name.

367
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:30,435
- Ernst?
- A Miss Tascha, I believe, sir.

368
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:33,372
He see a lot of girls? Enough
you wouldn't know her name?

369
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:36,976
I believe Ben maintained
an active social life.

370
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,112
<i>We didn't often</i>
<i>cross paths that way.</i>

371
00:20:41,381 --> 00:20:44,115
We only met over business.

372
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,818
You wouldn't have any
pictures from the party, sir,

373
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:49,020
by any chance?

374
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:51,656
Something to help us
identify the girl.

375
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,096
Mr. Caspere was dedicated
to his community.

376
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:01,065
A community of 95 residents.

377
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:04,468
He didn't seem distressed
by anything last you saw him?

378
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:07,405
No, just the usual headaches.

379
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:11,242
County can't forgive
our independence.

380
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:13,544
And you didn't talk to him much

381
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:15,178
outside of business
get-togethers?

382
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,248
And cabinet meetings
occasionally.

383
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,518
Well...

384
00:21:20,852 --> 00:21:22,486
thank you, Your Honor.
That'll do us.

385
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:25,656
Do you recall what time Mr. Caspere
left your house night of the party?

386
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,059
I believe around 11:00,
maybe 12:00.

387
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:31,594
- Around the time things broke up.
- With Miss Tascha?

388
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:33,763
Thank you, Your Honor.

389
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,532
Thank you, Detective.

390
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,701
I'd like to see this solved
as soon as possible.

391
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,043
Paul: <i>Got his bank
records, phone calls.</i>

392
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:48,812
<i>Don't know if he had</i>
<i>any of the lines, though.</i>

393
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:50,847
Starting to think he must
have kept other accounts.

394
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:54,350
Hey, kid, just save it
for the debrief.

395
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:56,352
Why are you here?

396
00:21:56,687 --> 00:21:58,254
You're not even
an investigator, right?

397
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:02,158
Special detail.
State owns the case.

398
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:05,627
Found his lawyer, too. Had to
hump all over LA for this shit.

399
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:08,697
Oh, and this one fag
at the bank

400
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:11,100
tried, like, hitting on me.

401
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:12,701
Almost clocked the guy.

402
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,570
Yeah?
Why would you do that?

403
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:17,373
Hey, no trouble here, stud.

404
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:19,575
Just leave me
out of it, all right?

405
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:42,897
His insurance had these forms.

406
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:45,566
Items likely stolen
from Caspere's place,

407
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,435
we can put out
pawn sheets on them.

408
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:50,305
What'd you guys get?

409
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:54,141
The young man here,
he got a dynamite anecdote.

410
00:22:56,979 --> 00:22:58,278
Last withdrawal
was five days ago.

411
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,147
<i>Nothing jumps except this.</i>

412
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:03,350
Once a month,
$4,000 cash withdrawal.

413
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,991
Let me see this.

414
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:18,132
The withdrawals seem
to come around the time

415
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:20,000
of these blank days
in his calendar.

416
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,004
- Did you get his GPS?
- Yeah.

417
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:28,174
Here.

418
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,578
There's nothing on those dates.

419
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:34,748
Car didn't go anywhere. Says
his Mercedes was a lease.

420
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:37,884
- Well, that makes sense.
- Not city. Catalast Group.

421
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:39,352
Why'd Catalast lease him a car?

422
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,225
Maybe somebody
should call them.

423
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,600
<i>( door opens )</i>

424
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,369
You tight with him?

425
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,103
I'm not tight with anybody.

426
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,039
<i>( door closes )</i>

427
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:04,810
Can I pick up here tomorrow?

428
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:07,179
Sure.

429
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,559
<i>( door opens )</i>

430
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:23,995
<i>( door closes )</i>

431
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:26,030
I gotta go.

432
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,241
- What?
- These coordinates.

433
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,743
They're up north.

434
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,746
Monterey County,
Fresno, Gilroy.

435
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,748
A lot of them on weekends.

436
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,829
Hey.

437
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,397
Where's Chad?

438
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,302
He's not coming.

439
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,705
What? Why?

440
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,441
You're gonna ask me why? Really?

441
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,809
You fucking prick.

442
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:14,410
What, that thing at the school?

443
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,412
I apologized to Chad and
it's between me and him.

444
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,448
That's not the end of the
story and you know it.

445
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,916
- How's that? - The police said that
someone beat up Wit Conroy.

446
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:24,120
Said it had something to do
with a schoolyard altercation.

447
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:25,488
Well, I don't know
anything about that,

448
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:28,224
but sometimes a good beating
provokes personal growth.

449
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,460
It's not like you know
any other way, right?

450
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:33,095
God damn it.

451
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:36,298
Chad gets anxious when
he has to be around you.

452
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,500
Do you get that?
Do you even see it?

453
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:40,903
That's bullshit.
I-- we talk,

454
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:43,906
we build models, we write
letters, I got him this recorder.

455
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
And how many times
has he written you back?

456
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:47,843
He needs me, all right,
even if he doesn't know it.

457
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:50,112
And if he gets anxious, it's
probably because he knows

458
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:52,014
he's gonna have to listen to his
mom talk shit about his dad.

459
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:55,784
Yeah.
You're bad, Ray.

460
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:57,352
You're a bad person.

461
00:25:57,687 --> 00:26:00,622
- And you're bad for my son.
- Don't say that.

462
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:03,559
You know me.

463
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:06,795
We had something and--

464
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:09,064
What I done for you, things
started to slip away from me--

465
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:10,498
No, you didn't
do that for me, Ray.

466
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:13,101
Don't you dare say
that you did that for me.

467
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:14,602
I had a right
by any natural law.

468
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:16,370
I had a right.

469
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:25,346
I came to tell you
this in person.

470
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:27,415
Richard didn't want me to.

471
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:29,483
I'm getting an emergency
writ for supervised visits.

472
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:32,052
What? No.

473
00:26:32,354 --> 00:26:34,788
We're petitioning
for sole custody.

474
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:36,824
What?

475
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:38,092
No, why?

476
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,561
Because this can't go on.

477
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,930
It can't.

478
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:45,332
I mean, look at yourself.

479
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,035
You will not-- no.
Please, please, don't.

480
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,971
You used to have
something, a decency.

481
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:53,607
You were good at being decent

482
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,976
until something happened.

483
00:26:56,377 --> 00:26:58,778
<i>You were fine as long</i>
<i>as everything else was fine.</i>

484
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:02,148
But then something happened and you
weren't strong enough to stay decent.

485
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,050
- And now--
- You won't get away with it.

486
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:07,220
I will burn this entire fucking
city to the ground first.

487
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,625
I'll petition for a
paternity test, too, Ray.

488
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:14,694
- If you make me.
- Don't. Please. Please, don't.

489
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:16,863
Don't do that, please.

490
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:19,665
God damn it, look,
he's-- he's all I--

491
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,400
all right, I'm a piece of shit,

492
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:23,702
but that boy is all I have
in my entire shitty life.

493
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:26,105
No, babe.

494
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:28,841
Then don't you know
he deserves better?

495
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:37,549
( breathing heavily )

496
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,075
<i>( horn honking )</i>

497
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:06,877
<i>( crashes )</i>

498
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,046
<i>( car door closes )</i>

499
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,882
Oh, fuck.
Son of a bitch.

500
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:14,686
Some asshole just rear-ended my car.
Look, you mother-- ah!

501
00:28:14,886 --> 00:28:16,921
( groaning )

502
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,989
( groans )
Fuck.

503
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:22,492
( groaning )
Son of--

504
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,328
Oh, fuck.

505
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:29,466
Next time, we put you in trunk.

506
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:37,740
- <i>( man groaning )</i>
<i>- ( tires squealing )</i>

507
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:40,343
Oh, fuck!

508
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:43,179
Jesus, buddy.
What was that about?

509
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,781
Oh, God, thank you.
Fuckin' me--

510
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,118
Why would somebody come
after you like that, guy?

511
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:50,786
I mean, that was crazy, right?

512
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:53,055
I don't know.
They just--

513
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,657
What did you do
to piss somebody off?

514
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,659
- Can you think of anything?
- What does that mean?

515
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,427
I don't know what that means.
I'm asking you.

516
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:01,296
What you might have did to get
guys like that after you.

517
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,432
Wait, do I know you?

518
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,768
I've never seen you before,
but I saw the whole thing.

519
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,803
And I wish we could
figure out what you did.

520
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:10,672
Like some kind of behavior that guys
like that would have issue with.

521
00:29:10,974 --> 00:29:12,908
Like mouthed off
or made a gesture

522
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,110
or you run a book
in Vinci sweatshops.

523
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,445
What?
Is that what this is?

524
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:20,548
Is what what what is? Is
that what you think this is?

525
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:24,186
It just seems to me like you
pissed off some serious people.

526
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:27,622
Maybe you ought
to take more care.

527
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:29,290
Just a thought, pal.

528
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:51,913
Velcoro and Bezzerides to see Dr. Pitlor.
We called ahead.

529
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,004
You do surgeries here?

530
00:30:18,205 --> 00:30:19,672
Only cosmetic.

531
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:22,175
The clinic employs a small
group of medical professionals

532
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:24,377
who cover a variety
of services.

533
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,015
This is quite a shock.

534
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:33,018
Anything he might have
told you that indicated

535
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:35,621
trouble, enemies?

536
00:30:37,591 --> 00:30:41,594
The reputation of this clinic rests
on its discretion, Officers.

537
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:44,096
Confidentiality.

538
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:46,532
Your patient was murdered.

539
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:48,400
He's got no living family.

540
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:56,041
Somebody burned out
his eyes with acid, Doc.

541
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:09,253
Well, of course
I am willing to help.

542
00:31:09,555 --> 00:31:11,155
I would hope I can, at least.

543
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:13,024
What were you treating him for?

544
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:16,461
A number of things.
Neuroses, anxiety,

545
00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:19,297
a painful past like many.

546
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,832
Guilt.

547
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,368
Guilt over what?

548
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:26,037
Ben had a weakness
for young women.

549
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:28,539
Paying for them,
more specifically.

550
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:31,476
He frequented escorts,
although it ignited in him

551
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:33,611
tremendous shame
and self-loathing,

552
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:37,748
which resulted in further
damaging tendencies.

553
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:41,752
- Old cycles.
- How long had he been seeing you?

554
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:44,254
About three years.

555
00:31:44,656 --> 00:31:47,124
Was he making any
progress, his therapy?

556
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:48,325
I like to think so.

557
00:31:48,627 --> 00:31:49,994
His relapses were less frequent

558
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:52,496
and he didn't compound them
with further damaging behavior.

559
00:31:52,864 --> 00:31:55,399
His habit, did he ever
mention any girls by name?

560
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:58,101
Favorite service?
Favorite girl?

561
00:31:58,536 --> 00:32:01,538
No, not that I recall, but I'd be
willing to go back over my notes.

562
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:05,375
What about the name Tascha?
He ever mention her?

563
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:09,879
Did he ever mention violence?
Trouble with a girl, a pimp?

564
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:13,683
He was sexually obsessed,
but he was not aggressive.

565
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:17,286
More... passive.

566
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:23,993
That's about as detailed as I'll
get airing Ben's personal issues.

567
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:28,397
This was helpful.
Thank you.

568
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:34,803
Your ID said
Antigone Bezzerides.

569
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:38,607
Are you related to Elliot
Bezzerides by any chance?

570
00:32:39,008 --> 00:32:41,277
- You know him?
- I used to a bit a long time ago.

571
00:32:41,644 --> 00:32:43,345
I did some social theory
with the Good People.

572
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:45,747
He had a daughter, I remember.

573
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,249
Good Lord, was that you?

574
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:50,852
I left all that behind.

575
00:32:51,087 --> 00:32:52,821
It was a fucked-up place.

576
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:55,624
Well, all kinds
of secrets in the world.

577
00:32:55,858 --> 00:32:57,492
All kinds of truth.

578
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,361
Five kids living there
when I was growing up.

579
00:33:00,696 --> 00:33:02,630
Two are in jail now,
two committed suicide.

580
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,299
How's that for social theory?

581
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:07,569
- And the fifth?
- She became a detective.

582
00:33:27,288 --> 00:33:30,290
Geldof: <i>To curb public
speculation in this homicide,</i>

583
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:32,893
<i>it's become necessary</i>
<i>to announce that our offices</i>

584

585
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,499
of Vinci in LA County.

586
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,034
- <i>This investigation is long overdue.</i>
<i>- ( door opens )</i>

587
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,537
<i>And we ask all state</i>

588
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:46,540
<i>and city officials</i>
<i>to cooperate...</i>

589
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:49,243
Attorney general
just announced a shakedown.

590
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,444
<i>( door closes )</i>

591
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:55,281
You're not supposed
to bring that here.

592
00:33:55,482 --> 00:33:58,118
It's short 10.

593
00:33:58,418 --> 00:34:00,820
When you took over
from Gene Slattery,

594
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:02,455
we established terms.

595
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:05,424
Short wasn't part of it, Frank.

596
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:07,059
I'm pulling
some stuff together.

597
00:34:07,294 --> 00:34:08,661
Adding revenue streams.

598
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:09,962
I just need a couple of weeks.

599
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,565
I sold the rent farms
and waste disposal business

600
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:14,534
to pull together the corridor money.
You know that.

601
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:16,369
You still owe
the poker room kickback.

602
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,471
Sell some of that land
if you need to.

603
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:21,106
Caspere died with
my money in his pocket.

604
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:25,644
I've had outside interest
re: the poker room.

605
00:34:25,945 --> 00:34:27,713
Think they can turn
a higher gross.

606
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:30,549
- <i>Higher vig.</i>
<i>- What outside interest?</i>

607
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,752
Just so you know,
it's a seller's market.

608
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:39,124
You seriously gonna
bust my balls over 10 Gs?

609
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:41,793
I kept this place tight
as a drum six years.

610
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:45,230
<i>Who squashed the undocumented
workers alliance?</i>

611
00:34:45,464 --> 00:34:46,531
That hit and run?

612
00:34:46,832 --> 00:34:48,400
Your son's face
was so coke-dusted

613
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:49,834
he looked like a clown.

614
00:34:50,102 --> 00:34:52,370
( chuckles )
Tony, yeah.

615
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:57,041
My son, I fear,

616
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:00,011
is losing his fucking mind.

617
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:02,914
Like his departed mother.

618
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:06,918
Some people can't handle
the deep trip.

619
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:09,187
<i>I fear he is a destroyer.</i>

620
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:12,823
<i>In my day, you understand, it was
about consciousness expansion,</i>

621
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:15,526
tracing the unseen web.

622
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:18,829
Children are a disappointment.

623
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:21,699
Remain unfettered, Frank.

624
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:25,202
They closer on
who killed Caspere?

625
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:28,772
( sniffs )

626
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:31,808
Catalast is taking over
his action.

627
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:34,077
Everything's happening.

628
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:37,614
My farkakte offspring I will
set up with a club in Oakland.

629
00:35:37,915 --> 00:35:40,050
Let him be
a boy prince elsewhere.

630
00:35:40,384 --> 00:35:42,552
Whoever killed Caspere,
they have my money.

631
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,021
- How's that?
- <i>The holding company is empty.</i>

632
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:48,358
The land was never purchased and
I'm fucked out of my life's work.

633
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:50,793
Now I need a direction
to turn, Austin.

634
00:35:51,094 --> 00:35:53,229
Or I may just start
pulling down walls.

635
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:58,568
That doesn't sound like
a smart play, <i>gever.</i>

636
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:01,003
Innuendo is nobody's friend.

637
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:04,706
You're not worried whoever did Caspere
might be part of something bigger?

638
00:36:05,108 --> 00:36:07,476
Muscling in on the corridor,
secret handshakes and whatnot.

639
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:11,013
Ben had his own charity
and what punched his ticket

640
00:36:11,347 --> 00:36:14,349
could have come from
some personal pocket.

641
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,755
Nobody muscles me, Frank.

642
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:22,491
<i>State attorney</i>
<i>will get his piece,</i>

643
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:25,226
Caspere will get closed,
the world will turn

644
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:27,462
uncaring of our struggles.

645
00:36:32,902 --> 00:36:36,704
They close Caspere,
I want a tip.

646
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,873
I want time alone
with the guy that did it.

647
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:44,378
You are industrious, Frank.

648
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:46,948
I want to see you
make it through this.

649
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,084
Who wants to move
on the poker room?

650
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:52,720
Kickback's an extra
15 next week, Frank.

651
00:36:52,954 --> 00:36:54,755
22.50 the week after.

652
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:56,890
You don't come through then,

653
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:59,327
<i>I have to entertain</i>
<i>other interests.</i>

654
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:01,329
It's business.

655
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:03,831
Sure.

656
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:19,546
Now this is making
some sense, right?

657
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:21,248
It explains his home decor.

658
00:37:21,682 --> 00:37:24,551
Nine to one the cash withdrawal
every month was a hooker blowout.

659
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:27,019
Guy's regularly in touch
with criminal elements.

660
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:31,491
Pimps,

661
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:33,125
they break in,
tortured him somewhere.

662
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:34,828
Probably trying
to get access to assets.

663
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,896
I think it's more
twisted than that.

664
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:38,965
What was done to him,
that shit in his house.

665
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,800
He's into a lot of stuff
we're just scratching.

666
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:45,704
Well, we can have Woodrugh
work prosts, escort services.

667
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:47,340
He'd be smooth for that.

668
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:51,043
Sure.

669
00:37:54,948 --> 00:37:57,583
You know that expression
about flies and honey?

670
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,519
Mmm. The fuck do I want
with a bunch of flies?

671
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:02,554
Well, you don't have flies,
you can't fly-fish.

672
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,567
( chatter )

673
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:18,703
Ani: What is this fucking place?

674
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:22,107
Suburban flight,

675
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:24,976
heavy manufacturing
moves inland or overseas,

676
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,811
plants close.

677
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:28,813
Except here, a bunch
of good capitalists

678
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:30,748
ran in for cheap leases,
tax incentives,

679
00:38:31,082 --> 00:38:33,718
<i>immigrant labor,</i>
<i>sweatshop economics.</i>

680
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:35,052
You don't have
a problem with that?

681
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:39,155
No, my strong suspicion is
we get the world we deserve.

682
00:38:43,761 --> 00:38:46,062
Why are you here?
This place?

683
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:50,834
I did time in the LA Sheriff's.

684
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:53,269
I just needed better pay.

685
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:56,306
Regular hours.

686
00:38:56,506 --> 00:38:58,874
I had a son.

687
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,315
They told you
about me, I'm sure.

688
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:07,951
Yeah, bosses said
you're a solid investigator.

689
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:11,520
I know you wouldn't think it,
but I don't bullshit.

690
00:39:11,788 --> 00:39:13,021
What would you say if you did?

691
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,824
Can I tell you what you
may or may not have heard,

692
00:39:15,224 --> 00:39:17,359
but almost definitely will
hear about my busted marriage?

693
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:20,062
Rumors have me killing this
piece of filth hurt my wife.

694
00:39:20,396 --> 00:39:22,164
Same rumors put me in hock
to a Southland mob.

695
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:23,866
And if you know who to ask,
you might hear I like to wet

696
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,434
now and then from a
number of bad habits.

697
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:27,369
- Any of that true?
- Oh, yeah.

698
00:39:27,636 --> 00:39:30,272
- Which parts?
- Bad habits.

699
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,976
Never lost one yet.

700
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:37,079
You?

701
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:40,115
Oh, I don't distinguish
between good and bad habits.

702
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,650
What's with all the knives?

703
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:45,019
Could you do this job
if everyone you encountered

704
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:47,755
could physically overpower you?

705
00:39:48,056 --> 00:39:49,290
I mean, forget police work.

706
00:39:49,658 --> 00:39:51,526
No man could walk around
like that without going nuts.

707
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:53,928
So they're equalizers.
Makes sense.

708
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:56,498
<i>No, I'd still wear them</i>
<i>if I wasn't on the job.</i>

709
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:59,133
Fundamental difference
between the sexes

710
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:02,803
is that one of them can kill the
other with their bare hands.

711
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:05,272
Man of any size
lays hands on me,

712
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:07,174
he's gonna bleed out
in under a minute.

713
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:12,013
Well, just so you know,
I support feminism.

714
00:40:12,314 --> 00:40:14,948
Mostly by having
body image issues.

715
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:24,257
What's that thing
Pitlor mentioned?

716
00:40:24,526 --> 00:40:26,226
Your dad, the Good People?

717
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:30,296
It was this, like,
commune around Guerneville

718
00:40:30,532 --> 00:40:32,432
in the late '70s, '80s.

719
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,901
Hippie shit.

720
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:37,003
You had to look out
for yourself, huh?

721
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:47,347
That's you.

722
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:07,999
Look, I'm trying to effect
transparency between us.

723
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,834
The reason being...

724
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:13,772
I don't know if you know this,

725
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,908
but us, the investigation,

726
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,810
I don't think
it's supposed to work.

727
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:20,812
Why is that?

728
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,513
<i>State attorney's investigation.</i>

729
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:25,750
They must have tapped you.
You know, the kid, too.

730
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:28,186
Why wouldn't they have a team of
state grand jury investigators

731
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,722
working Vinci instead
of just you and the kid?

732
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,925
Why wouldn't the SA do a
full-court press on this?

733
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:40,364
( sighs )
You want honest?

734
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,067
Tell me, how
compromised are you?

735
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:56,246
Anyways, good night.

736
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,650
What is that?
Why didn't you tell me?

737
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:38,121
- What the fuck?
- <i>Hmm?</i>

738

That's it.

744
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,101
Then why didn't you tell me?

745
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:54,836
'Cause I don't want

- No.

747
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:58,641
I got a new assignment
through the state attorney.

748
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:00,709
I'm gonna be a detective after.

749
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,978
Listen, this paper
talks about you

750
00:43:03,312 --> 00:43:04,780
being in this Black
Mountain Security thing.

751
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:08,349
I told you, I don't
talk about the desert.

752
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:11,186
But this Black Mountain Security,
they did things, bad--

753
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:25,099
So that's it?
You're just taking off?

754
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:27,302
Come on, I just told you.

755
00:43:27,636 --> 00:43:30,171
I got to go to LA
to work for a while.

756

They say vodka don't smell,
but that's bullshit.

759

You smell just like my uncle.

760
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:42,016
I'm just going

I can't do this anymore.
I tried.

765

No.

You barely talk.

I don't know your family.
You don't want to know mine.

Yeah, fuck off.
Go.

Don't. I don't want to

you're not right.

It's hard work up in here.

I gotta say, being back

Every one of these bitches
think this is "Pretty Woman."

806
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:40,789
I need to know if any
of your girls knew a guy

807
00:46:41,023 --> 00:46:42,657
liked young trim.

808
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:46,227
Maybe, like, a few months ago.

809
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:49,464
He booked a date at his place.

810
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,201
In Vinci?
The big house?

811
00:46:54,669 --> 00:46:57,638
No, this place small.
In Hollywood.

812
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,007
Took-over home.

813
00:46:59,308 --> 00:47:00,208
You remember where it was?

814
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:03,211
Go ahead, girl, speak.

815
00:47:06,215 --> 00:47:07,748
I write them down.

816
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,851
Danny says you pay
attention to streets,

817

This guy, he do anything scary?

819
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:19,927
Anything might have
pissed somebody off?

820
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:21,829
No.
He kind of...

821
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,298
weak, you say?

822
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:27,067
Just want to watch.

823
00:47:27,368 --> 00:47:28,868
Write it down
where you met him.

824
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:36,977
I hope this goodwill does not go
unnoticed on your end, Frank.

825

Said Vera last called her
a couple months ago.

Asked if anybody'd
come around looking for her.

Listen, I've been

things shake out like I expect,

872
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:35,974
this time next year,
might be Chief of PD-- Vinci.

873

How'd that be?

want that, Frank.

That job pays 300K a year.

00:51:47,419 --> 00:51:50,188
You could hire a hell of a
family lawyer for that.

879
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:53,925
( chuckles )
That right there.

880
00:51:56,161 --> 00:52:00,964
You-- you remember
how we got together?

881

I remember you dumping a body.

882

The reasons for all
this, all that,

883
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:09,006
might not exist for me anymore.

You see?

885
00:52:12,043 --> 00:52:14,844
I got no reason
to keep at this.

886
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:17,814
Meaning you'd consider
life in prison, what,

887
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:19,148
a positive?

888
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,883
No, I ain't saying that either.

889
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:23,386
What, you have other options
here I'm not privy to?

890

Everybody's got the one option,

- Then get some sleep.

895
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:39,168
Get back to me.

And, Ray...

897
00:52:44,808 --> 00:52:46,742
I don't want to hear
you talk like that again.

898
00:53:00,523 --> 00:53:02,157
You want another beer, Ray?

899
00:53:02,424 --> 00:53:05,894
No, I-- I gotta

901
00:53:08,831 --> 00:53:10,498
Yes, ma'am.

902
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:21,609
You ought to take some time.

903
00:53:21,777 --> 00:53:23,678
A vacation.

904
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:25,647
Have you ever been
to San Miguel de Allende?

905
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:27,615
- No.
- That's where I'm from.

906
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:32,420

Well, that sounds really nice.

Maybe I could show it
to you sometime.

a vacation is if I croak.

910

You should get
another job, then.
