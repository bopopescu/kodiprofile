1
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:45,709
Please, my love.

2
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,626
Please, my dearest.
Do not be upset.

3
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,917
It was a mistake.

4
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:54,876
I didn't know she was
in this condition. My love, please.

5
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:17,792
Please, my love...

6
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:39,459
Forgive me, my love.

7
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,167
I will make you happy.

8
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,501
Who are you?

9
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:42,584
I would not bother you

10
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:46,334
if I were not certain
that Your Majesties

11
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:51,042
will attach great importance
to what I'm about to say.

12
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:54,792
I've heard the promises
of many charlatans before.

13
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:57,917
And you have put many
in the stocks.

14
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,042
Fortunately,
that does not concern me.

15
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:04,959
You seem very sure of yourself.

16
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,209
What will it cost?

17
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,834
An act of courage and of sacrifice.

18
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:14,917
What d'you mean by that?

19
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:18,876
Birth is always stained by death.

20
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:23,042
And death, in turn,
is simply one element of birth

21
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,417
and not even the most dramatic one.

22
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:30,959
Be less mysterious.
Come to the point.

23
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:34,917
You want a child?

24
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:41,376
Every new life
calls for a life to be lost.

25
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:45,917
The equilibrium of the world
must be maintained.

26
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,417
Do you understand?

27
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:53,126
I am prepared to die in order
to feel life grow inside me.

28
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:57,792
We are speaking of possibility,
not certainty.

29
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:01,417
Are you willing to accept the risk?

30
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,501
What must we do?

31
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:10,709
Hunt down a sea monster.

32
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:15,292
Cut out its heart
and have it cooked by a virgin.

33
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:18,417
But she must be alone.

34
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:24,376
When Your Majesty eats the heart

35
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:30,417
you will become pregnant
instantly.

36
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:42,376
Which is the girl?

37
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,709
You, come here.

38
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,792
You are still a virgin, right?

39
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,709
Come with me,
the queen needs you.

40
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,417
Hurry UP!

41
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:08,209
It's coming, Your Majesty.
It's coming.

42
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,542
What's happening?
What's happening?

43
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:43,042
SIXTEEN YEARS LATER

44
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,626
Elias!

45
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,834
Elias!

46
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,751
Where are you, my DOV?

47
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,626
Stop!

48
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:17,376
Elias!

49
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,209
<i>Your Highness!</i>

50
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:01,334
<i>Your Highness!</i>

51
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,459
<i>Your Highness!</i>

52
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:33,417
<i>Your Highness!</i>

53
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:46,792
Your Highness!

54
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,542
Your Highness!

55
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,876
Why must you continue
to disobey my commands?

56
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,001
How many times have I told you?

57
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:07,167
They must stop seeing each other.

58
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:13,209
The next time that bastard boy
of yours comes anywhere near my son

59
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:15,584
I will throw you both out.

60
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,001
You understand?

61
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,126
Don't look at me!

62
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:24,834
Now go.

63
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:40,709
What does she have to do with this?
What has she done wrong?

64
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:44,876
Take it out on me if you have to,
but leave her out of it.

65
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,376
How dare you talk to me like that?

66
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:50,292
You disrespect me
and you disobey me.

67
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:53,001
You know you were not supposed
to see him.

68
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:56,542
Come here.

69
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,459
Elias, you are a prince.

70
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:08,626
You cannot befriend
of a son of a servant.

71
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:12,376
But I like being with him.

72
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:15,751
He's like a brother to me,
I will see him whenever I want.

73
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,417
A brother?

74
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:21,584
The only one bond of blood
that you have is with me.

75
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:23,876
Your mother!

76
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:28,626
And it's to me that you owe
respect and obedience.

77
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:31,959
I am your queen,
don't you ever forget it.

78
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,209
You owe me an apology.

79
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,292
I'm sorry, mother.

80
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:47,167
Come.

81
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:57,792
My son...

82
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:08,417
If I ever see you with him again,
you will both regret it.

83
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:37,376
Who sings with
such a beautiful voice?

84
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:43,626
Where have you been hiding
all this time?

85
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:48,209
How is it that I have never met you?

86
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:50,917
Never even seen you?

87
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:54,876
How old are you?

88
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,376
Seventeen?

89
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,876
Eighteen?

90
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:04,459
No, don't go! Don't go!
Don't hide!

91
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:06,959
Stay out in the sunlight.

92
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:12,709
Please, stay out
to warm your cold king.

93
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:19,667
Oh I see!
So you want to play hard to get.

94
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:22,376
Well, so be it.

95
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:26,126
I have fought many wars in my time.

96
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:32,626
And even the most impregnable
fortress surrenders at last.

97
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,667
<i>Who is it?</i>

98
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:07,376
I have a gift for you,
from your king.

99
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,667
What is it?

100
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,334
It's beautiful!

101
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,917
- Let me try it, Dora.
- Wait.

102
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:07,584
Wait!

103
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:11,751
- Dora, please...
- Get the mirror.

104
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,542
Stop it!

105
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,917
You don't think
we have to give it back?

106
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:33,626
To the king?

107
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:35,917
No.

108
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:38,834
What good is it to us?

109
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:42,584
Makes us look more beautiful.
Don't you think?

110
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:46,334
But whoever sees us?
We're always shut up inside here.

111
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:51,959
I see you, silly.

112
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:56,542
There...

113
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,876
Okay, I'll keep this.

114
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:19,001
- At the closing of the day, oh Lord.
- Watch over us as we sleep.

115
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:22,334
Keep us safe and warm in Your heart.

116
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:56,334
Who is it?

117
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:02,167
<i>It's me... your king.</i>

118
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:06,334
Did you like my present?

119
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:09,251
Have you tried it on?

120
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:14,251
<i>My royal heart is very generous,
you know?</i>

121
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:19,709
<i>Ever since this morning
when I first heard you sing,</i>

122
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,626
I have been burning
in the furnace of desire. Come on!

123
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,334
Open up this door,
so I can see you.

124
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:32,251
Hello?

125
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:36,126
Sir, there must be
some misunderstanding...

126
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,584
I see...

127
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:46,542
You are going to tease me,
aren't you?

128
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,751
Let me see you, for heaven's sake!

129
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:59,667
You like playing with your king?

130
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:02,584
Play with you, sir?

131
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,876
Oh no!

132
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:09,501
I'm just a poor girl, I don't deserve
the honor you bestow on me.

133
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:15,292
The honor! What honor!
It's desire that drives me.

134
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,417
Open up this door, let me in.
Let me see you, for damned sake!

135
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,584
- Dora, what shall we do?
- Let me think.

136
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:25,709
We must not let
an opportunity like this get away.

137
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:29,251
- Your Majesty...
- Yes?

138
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:33,001
You can't imagine how the modesty
of this young virgin

139
00:34:33,209 --> 00:34:35,709
is being put to the test
by your offer.

140
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,376
I...

141
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,542
All my heart's aflutter.

142
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:43,834
I feel faint.

143
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:47,584
But all I can promise you today

144
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:49,876
is this:

145
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:53,626
come back in a week's time

146
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:56,542
and I will give you a part of me

147
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:59,876
that alone illustrates my beauty.

148
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:07,167
Which part of your body
will you grant me?

149
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:15,501
A finger, Your Majesty.

150
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:20,501
A finger?

151
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,084
A finger...

152
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:33,834
Well... All right, my jasmine flower,
my little honeysuckle.

153
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,167
I shall wait

154
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:41,542
and I shall return and admire
the eighth wonder of the world,

155
00:35:41,751 --> 00:35:44,459
your rosy maidenly finger.

156
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:51,542
What shall we do, Dora?

157
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,084
We'll think of something.

158
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:36,334
This next piece
I composed myself for my father,

159
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,667
to whom I dedicate it
with all my heart.

160
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:36,542
"He grabs the iron bars
pulling and shaking them,

161
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:40,084
bending the metal and tearing
the bars from the wall."

162
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:43,417
Could you just read the part
where they kiss?

163
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:49,667
"Then the queen her arms extends,

164
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:52,792
and to her breast his head she bends,

165
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:56,126
and on the bed in warm embrace,

166
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:59,251
the queen displays her radiant face."

167
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:02,792
Now Lancelot has what he desires,

168
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,917
the queen's embrace sets him on fire,

169
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:10,501
so sweet a game to kiss and hold.

170
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:14,251
Such pleasure this, if truth be told,

171
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:19,042
no one ever felt before,
such joy in loving they adore."

172
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,834
And now we should leave.

173
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:27,584
Could we read it again?

174
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:45,292
<i>- Your Majesty.
- Yes?</i>

175
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:48,626
<i>- Some</i> papers <i>to sign.</i>
- Later. Later.

176
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:53,001
<i>I'm sorry, Your Majesty, they are
rather urgent, people want paying.</i>

177
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:55,292
All is so urgent.

178
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,917
<i>My lord and father,</i>

179
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:44,834
at my age a girl
should already know

180
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:47,792
what sort of gallantries
men are capable of.

181
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:52,751
She should be learning to distinguish
whose heart is sincere

182
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,959
and who instead tells lies.

183
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:59,501
If I stay here,
my head will always be empty,

184
00:41:59,709 --> 00:42:02,042
and I fear my heart will be too.

185
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:07,042
Before long you will be
old enough to be married

186
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:10,334
and then you will depart
these walls forever.

187
00:42:11,334 --> 00:42:12,792
Well...

188
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,959
If that is indeed the case,

189
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,251
then find me a husband.

190
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:24,251
A husband?

191
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,917
What sort of husband would you like?

192
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:32,167
Well...
I'd like my husband to be

193
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:36,334
courageous and strong and...

194
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:39,042
handsome.

195
00:42:39,251 --> 00:42:41,667
I'm sure such a man exists,

196
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:43,959
but until we find him,

197
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:45,626
please,

198
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:50,001
do not agitate yourself over a future
none of us can predict.

199
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:53,126
Now, let us finish our supper.

200
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:04,709
- What is it, my dear?
- It's not cooked enough.

201
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,834
Really?

202
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:30,084
Yes, yes, yes...

203
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,001
Hello?

204
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:38,417
Hello?

205
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,292
Elias!

206
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:07,167
Come, my DOY-

207
00:46:09,876 --> 00:46:11,542
Come near me.

208
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:15,584
I can't make up my mind
about the earrings tonight.

209
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:18,917
Would you help me?
Which one do you like better.

210
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:25,376
Should we try them on?

211
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,584
Did you take your lesson?

212
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:40,709
Yes, earlier.

213
00:46:57,376 --> 00:46:59,251
MaY I go now?

214
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:01,751
Of course.

215
00:47:03,626 --> 00:47:05,084
Good night.

216
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:11,751
Elias...

217
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:14,876
You won't believe this.

218
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:16,334
What happened?

219
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,834
I was just in your mother's room.

220
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:23,626
- What?
- Don't worry. I was in her room.

221
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:26,126
She thought I was you.

222
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:29,042
No... impossible...

223
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:33,209
- You are playing with me.
- She thought I was you.

224
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,501
I was in her room... me!

225
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:40,084
- <i>You are not joking?
- She thought I was you, I swear.</i>

226
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:42,584
<i>She actually called me Elias.</i>

227
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:46,126
Do you know what this means?

228
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:48,626
What?

229
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:52,167
If we've managed to fool
even my mother,

230
00:47:52,584 --> 00:47:54,917
we can do whatever we want.

231
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:59,876
- What?
- I'll be eighteen soon.

232
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:05,501
Then I'll have the throne and
we can take it in turns being king.

233
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:07,584
- What? Take turns?
- Yes.

234
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:10,292
<i>Me one day, you the next.
What do you say?</i>

235
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:13,001
<i>- Me, king?
- Yes.</i>

236
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:15,292
<i>Imagine how happy my mother will be.</i>

237
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:18,001
<i>You could do whatever you wanted.</i>

238
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:20,709
<i>Maybe I could make her a noblewoman</i>

239
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:23,001
<i>and maybe she could have
a little castle as well.</i>

240
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:26,751
We're king,
we don't have to listen anybody.

241
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:29,042
We could give her
everything she desires.

242
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:31,542
- Everything.
- Just perfect!

243
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:35,084
But we have to keep this a secret.

244
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,334
Yes!

245
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:38,834
Between you and me, nobody can know.

246
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,042
- <i>Who</i> is it?
<i>- It's me, your mother.</i>

247
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:47,792
One moment!

248
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:49,376
This way.

249
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:51,251
Jonah, my jacket!

250
00:48:53,209 --> 00:48:55,084
Help me.

251
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:57,959
Come in, mother.

252
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,334
What is it?

253
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:12,167
Nothing...
I just wanted to see you.

254
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:25,084
You have my hands.

255
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:29,251
Even though you were inside me
only one night,

256
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:32,001
you still managed to take on my form.

257
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:38,459
You have no idea
how much I wanted you.

258
00:49:40,501 --> 00:49:43,626
How much I sacrificed for you.

259
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:46,876
You told me many times before.

260
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:55,292
No one will ever love you like I do.

261
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:21,334
See you tomorrow?

262
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:23,209
YES.

263
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,209
Your Highness, please.

264
00:53:07,876 --> 00:53:09,542
Your Highness!

265
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:14,876
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

266
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:17,167
Jonah!

267
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:19,876
What are you doing?

268
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:25,501
Jonah! Why are you leaving?

269
00:53:25,709 --> 00:53:27,376
I have to go.

270
00:53:28,209 --> 00:53:29,417
Why? What's happened?

271
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:32,167
I have to, don't ask me
anything more.

272
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,459
You can't just leave like this.

273
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,751
I've made up my mind,
I have no choice.

274
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:39,042
Please, be well and don't forget me.

275
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:41,334
No!

276
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:44,876
I'm your king and
I order you to stay.

277
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:52,167
Come... Look.

278
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:17,792
You come to this spring every day

279
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:20,917
and here you will see
the flow of my life.

280
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:23,834
If the water runs clear,

281
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:26,751
you will know that my life too
is clear and serene.

282
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:30,917
If it runs muddy,
you will know that I am in trouble.

283
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:37,167
If it dries up, you will know
that I have too reached my end.

284
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:36,959
You! Stop that!

285
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:41,542
Get away from here!

286
00:55:42,376 --> 00:55:43,834
Go!

287
00:57:28,626 --> 00:57:30,501
Dora...

288
00:57:32,584 --> 00:57:34,251
Dora...

289
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:46,542
<i>Here I am, my little darling.</i>

290
00:57:49,251 --> 00:57:52,584
<i>Having counted the days
and numbered the nights,</i>

291
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:54,876
<i>at long last,</i>

292
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:57,751
your king is here.

293
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:00,251
Now...

294
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:05,667
my precious one,
show me what you promised.

295
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:15,667
Dora! Dora!

296
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,459
Beautiful!

297
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:31,751
So soft and tender.

298
00:58:33,834 --> 00:58:35,709
Sweet smelling.

299
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:47,167
Now, my dearest heart,

300
00:58:47,376 --> 00:58:50,501
now that you have shown me
your beautiful finger,

301
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:54,667
show me the rest,
show me your face,

302
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:59,167
show me your mouth, your neck,
so I can kiss it. Please!

303
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:10,292
Now courtesy demands that I ask

304
00:59:10,501 --> 00:59:13,959
for something that
I could freely take,

305
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:16,042
without any pretext.

306
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:18,334
I'm your king, don't forget!

307
00:59:20,084 --> 00:59:21,751
Your Majesty...

308
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,834
my royal lord,

309
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:27,376
since you have deigned

310
00:59:27,584 --> 00:59:31,126
to demean yourself,
leaving your lofty chambers

311
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,042
to come to this lowly pigsty,

312
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:39,251
far be it from me to dispute
the will of such a great king.

313
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:42,167
Therefore...

314
00:59:42,376 --> 00:59:44,459
I am ready

315
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:47,167
and willing to grant your desires.

316
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:53,209
I only ask of you this one favor.

317
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:55,084
Of course.

318
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:58,417
<i>I be welcomed into your bed</i>

319
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:01,334
<i>in the darkness of the night,</i>

320
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:03,626
<i>without any candles,</i>

321
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:06,959
<i>for my heart could not withstand</i>

322
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:09,667
<i>you seeing me naked.</i>

323
01:00:10,709 --> 01:00:13,417
Of course, my beautiful angel.

324
01:00:13,626 --> 01:00:15,292
Anything you like.

325
01:00:47,584 --> 01:00:49,251
Do it!

326
01:00:51,959 --> 01:00:53,626
More.

327
01:00:56,334 --> 01:00:59,251
Let me see. Let me see.

328
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:01,334
Okay. Hold it.

329
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:03,417
Hold it.

330
01:01:08,626 --> 01:01:11,334
Good ".good".

331
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:15,292
And the other one.

332
01:01:16,959 --> 01:01:19,042
Shut up, Imma!

333
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:38,876
Keep us safe and warm
in your heart.

334
01:02:39,459 --> 01:02:43,001
Always and forever and ever,
keep us warm...

335
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:46,126
And safe from everything.

336
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:04,876
Guards!

337
01:04:05,292 --> 01:04:06,959
Guards!

338
01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:14,667
You summoned me, Your Majesty.

339
01:04:14,876 --> 01:04:17,126
Silence!
You tricked me, you witch!

340
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:21,417
Throw her out.

341
01:04:21,626 --> 01:04:23,084
No!

342
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:26,084
Throw her out. Now! Do it!

343
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:30,292
You wanted me to come!

344
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:25,501
What are you doing up there?

345
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:31,751
There is nothing to laugh at.

346
01:05:33,834 --> 01:05:36,126
I'm not funny!

347
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:41,667
- Help me down!
- Yes, I'll help you down.

348
01:05:49,876 --> 01:05:52,376
You shouldn't be up in a tree
at your age.

349
01:05:52,584 --> 01:05:54,459
Help me down.

350
01:06:00,084 --> 01:06:02,584
Oh dear, oh dear...

351
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:06,751
All this complaining.

352
01:06:11,959 --> 01:06:13,834
Now, now...

353
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:32,792
Come on now.

354
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:39,459
There we go.

355
01:06:41,542 --> 01:06:44,667
Come on... Come on...

356
01:06:47,584 --> 01:06:49,251
There...

357
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:53,417
This too will pass.

358
01:06:53,834 --> 01:06:55,917
Everything passes.

359
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:30,709
Doctor! Doctor!

360
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,417
Come quick, the king
needs you right away.

361
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:35,709
I'm coming. I'm coming.

362
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:40,084
Your Majesty, the doctor!

363
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:49,251
It's a respiratory problem.

364
01:09:49,459 --> 01:09:51,542
What are your symptoms?

365
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:53,834
Not me! Not me!

366
01:09:58,417 --> 01:10:00,501
- Come.
- What's this?

367
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:02,292
Come!

368
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:05,917
Come... Please...

369
01:10:06,126 --> 01:10:09,459
- Come!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

370
01:10:11,126 --> 01:10:13,209
Please... Please...

371
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:21,959
- What is this?
- I don't know what beast this is!

372
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:27,792
Oh dear! That's not good.

373
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:32,584
Do something!

374
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:36,751
Your Highness...

375
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:39,667
Oh, dear...

376
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:51,959
Your Highness...

377
01:10:53,209 --> 01:10:54,876
Unfortunately...

378
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:09,001
Doctor...

379
01:11:11,542 --> 01:11:14,667
You must tell no one
of what you have seen this evening.

380
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:17,792
- Your Majesty...
- No one!

381
01:11:52,584 --> 01:11:55,084
This is my favorite color.

382
01:11:56,126 --> 01:11:59,667
- I love this.
- Neckline is very attractive.

383
01:12:05,084 --> 01:12:07,792
So have you found
something to please you?

384
01:12:08,001 --> 01:12:11,126
Yes. They are all so beautiful.

385
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:13,626
Why did you send for them?

386
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:17,167
You want to look beautiful
on your wedding day, don't you?

387
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:21,751
So, I'm to be married?

388
01:12:21,959 --> 01:12:23,626
Of course.

389
01:12:23,834 --> 01:12:27,792
You were right, Violet.
It's time I found you a husband.

390
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:31,542
I understand you are bored
living here with us at the castle

391
01:12:31,751 --> 01:12:35,501
and in this way you can venture forth
and discover new places.

392
01:12:35,709 --> 01:12:39,459
- It's what you wanted.
- Yes!

393
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:42,792
Then, who will my husband be, father?

394
01:12:43,001 --> 01:12:44,667
Well...

395
01:12:45,084 --> 01:12:48,626
He will be braver than
the most valiant knight

396
01:12:48,834 --> 01:12:51,959
and wiser even than
our own court doctor.

397
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:54,251
Thank you.

398
01:12:54,459 --> 01:12:58,501
- What is his name?
- Not even I know his name yet.

399
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:03,834
How can that be?
Do you not know him?

400
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:07,376
Surely, as an avid reader
you know that

401
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:10,917
the husband of a princess can only
be discovered through a tournament.

402
01:13:11,751 --> 01:13:13,834
So I won't choose him myself.

403
01:13:14,042 --> 01:13:16,167
What if I don't love him?

404
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:22,167
You will love him, Violet.
You will.

405
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:28,001
Of course, it is possible that
no suitor will pass the test.

406
01:13:31,126 --> 01:13:33,001
Then what will I do?

407
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:36,126
Then fate will have decided

408
01:13:36,334 --> 01:13:39,876
that you must live a while longer
with your old father.

409
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,792
Your turn.

410
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:17,584
This is the hide of a sow.

411
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:20,501
No.

412
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:24,667
Next!

413
01:14:31,959 --> 01:14:35,084
- He is very serious.
- He's old.

414
01:14:51,334 --> 01:14:54,542
Verrus singularis silvano.

415
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:00,501
No.

416
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:07,251
Verrus singularis silvano... No!

417
01:15:07,459 --> 01:15:09,126
Next!

418
01:15:28,417 --> 01:15:30,709
- Father...
- A moment!

419
01:15:31,334 --> 01:15:34,667
- What is it?
- Please, I'm longing to know.

420
01:15:34,876 --> 01:15:38,001
Just tell me what piece
that strange hide belongs to.

421
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:40,084
No, it's forbidden.

422
01:15:40,917 --> 01:15:43,834
- I won't tell a soul.
- It's impossible.

423
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:46,751
I'm your daughter!

424
01:15:49,876 --> 01:15:53,626
Oh very well, I can deny you nothing.

425
01:15:55,501 --> 01:15:58,626
You wish to know to which beast
this hide belongs?

426
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:00,084
YES.

427
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:04,876
It is the skin of a flea.

428
01:16:14,251 --> 01:16:15,709
Continue.

429
01:16:22,209 --> 01:16:23,876
Giant manatee.

430
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,667
Sorry.

431
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:31,334
No.

432
01:16:33,459 --> 01:16:35,126
Next!

433
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:49,876
No, no...

434
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:53,417
Everyone has the right to guess.

435
01:16:53,626 --> 01:16:55,709
- Father...
- It's fine.

436
01:17:16,126 --> 01:17:17,584
Flea.

437
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:23,667
What?

438
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:27,667
Flea!

439
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:46,126
Violet!

440
01:17:57,584 --> 01:17:59,042
No!

441
01:17:59,251 --> 01:18:00,709
Violet!

442
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:02,584
No! Wait!

443
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:05,001
Please, StOP!

444
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:10,834
I never imagined anyone would guess.

445
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:13,626
I'm sorry.

446
01:18:13,834 --> 01:18:15,501
I understand.

447
01:18:16,126 --> 01:18:20,501
It was never my intention that
I would give you to such a monster.

448
01:18:21,959 --> 01:18:25,292
But what can I do?
You heard the proclamation.

449
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:28,834
I can't go back on my word.
Violet!

450
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:32,792
Patience, my blessed child.

451
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,334
Perhaps... Perhaps... Violet...

452
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:42,376
Perhaps the will of God
is behind this unusual fate.

453
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:46,959
I know you are scared but...

454
01:18:47,584 --> 01:18:51,959
My heart tells me that
you will find a strength to be happy.

455
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:54,667
Happy?

456
01:18:56,334 --> 01:19:00,084
You tried to deceive me
with your words, father!

457
01:19:00,292 --> 01:19:03,834
Your heart tells you?
You have no heart!

458
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:08,001
Silence! You forget the duties
and obligations of a king.

459
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:12,792
You're not a king.

460
01:19:13,626 --> 01:19:15,709
You're not even a man.

461
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,001
Not even a beast.

462
01:19:18,209 --> 01:19:21,334
Beasts at least love their offspring.

463
01:19:21,542 --> 01:19:23,626
They try to protect them.

464
01:19:23,834 --> 01:19:27,167
But not you. I'm nothing to you.

465
01:19:29,459 --> 01:19:32,167
I wish that my mother
had strangled me in my crib

466
01:19:32,376 --> 01:19:34,209
instead of leaving me in your hands.

467
01:19:34,417 --> 01:19:36,084
Silence!

468
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:38,792
Whatever I do is done well.

469
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:45,084
No one has the right to question
my will, least of all my daughter!

470
01:20:07,584 --> 01:20:12,167
Fear not,
your obligations shall be respected.

471
01:20:12,376 --> 01:20:16,542
No one will be able to say that
the king did not keep to his word.

472
01:23:11,334 --> 01:23:12,792
Sit.

473
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:05,084
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
I've looked everywhere.

474
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:06,959
I can't find him.

475
01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:12,584
What d'you mean, you can't find him?

476
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:21,751
<i>Your Highness!</i>

477
01:25:29,251 --> 01:25:31,126
Elias!

478
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:35,501
<i>Your Highness!</i>

479
01:26:14,251 --> 01:26:15,709
It's him!

480
01:26:17,751 --> 01:26:21,126
He's back! Fenizia!

481
01:26:21,334 --> 01:26:23,501
He's back, Jonah is alive!

482
01:26:30,709 --> 01:26:33,834
Jonah, my love! Jonah!

483
01:26:36,542 --> 01:26:38,834
We knew you would come back to us.

484
01:26:39,042 --> 01:26:41,751
You have no idea how long
we've been looking for you!

485
01:27:04,876 --> 01:27:06,959
How much time has passed?

486
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:12,376
I'm...
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

487
01:27:12,584 --> 01:27:14,876
Five days.
You've been gone five days.

488
01:27:15,084 --> 01:27:16,959
Where did I go?

489
01:27:18,626 --> 01:27:20,709
The forest.

490
01:27:21,334 --> 01:27:24,459
The forest...
Why was I in the forest?

491
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,959
Where is he?

492
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:40,917
He is searching for his friend.

493
01:27:41,334 --> 01:27:45,292
You wanted to separate
what is inseparable.

494
01:27:47,584 --> 01:27:49,667
I want my son back.

495
01:27:50,542 --> 01:27:53,667
Now I will repeat what I told you.

496
01:27:54,251 --> 01:27:58,209
Every desire, every action
corresponds to another.

497
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:01,959
A violent desire such as yours

498
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:04,834
can only be satisfied with violence.

499
01:28:05,459 --> 01:28:08,792
And there will be a cost.

500
01:28:09,001 --> 01:28:11,501
You know I'm willing to pay it.

501
01:28:40,501 --> 01:28:41,959
Jonah!

502
01:28:49,876 --> 01:28:51,626
Jonah, can you hear me?

503
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:26,126
Help!

504
01:29:27,584 --> 01:29:29,667
I'm here, help me!

505
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:37,167
Help!

506
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:46,959
I'm here! Help me!

507
01:30:45,084 --> 01:30:46,751
<i>Jonah!</i>

508
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:49,459
Elias!

509
01:30:57,584 --> 01:30:59,042
Help!

510
01:31:00,084 --> 01:31:02,417
- I'm coming!
- Help me!

511
01:31:02,626 --> 01:31:06,167
- Quick! Help me!
- Don't worry, I'm here.

512
01:31:07,792 --> 01:31:09,667
Quick! Oh, my God!

513
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:22,792
An invitation to the king's wedding.

514
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,459
Who sent it to me?

515
01:34:29,876 --> 01:34:31,959
The future queen.

516
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:39,876
Dora...

517
01:36:22,376 --> 01:36:23,834
Imma!

518
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:28,626
It's me.

519
01:36:35,709 --> 01:36:37,792
It's me, Dora.

520
01:36:38,834 --> 01:36:40,917
I've missed you so much!

521
01:36:42,584 --> 01:36:44,042
Imma...

522
01:36:44,251 --> 01:36:45,917
It's me.

523
01:36:46,334 --> 01:36:47,792
Dora.

524
01:36:50,917 --> 01:36:52,792
I don't know what happened.

525
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:54,876
I fell asleep.

526
01:36:55,501 --> 01:36:58,626
When I woke up
I had changed my skin.

527
01:36:59,042 --> 01:37:01,126
What do you mean?

528
01:37:03,001 --> 01:37:07,167
I changed my skin, I don't know...

529
01:37:10,084 --> 01:37:12,167
You're so beautiful.

530
01:37:16,542 --> 01:37:18,626
Young...

531
01:37:27,167 --> 01:37:28,834
Dora...

532
01:37:29,042 --> 01:37:31,959
From now on, you don't have
to worry about a thing.

533
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:34,251
I'll take care of you.

534
01:37:34,459 --> 01:37:38,001
Anything you want,
it will be yours.

535
01:37:42,167 --> 01:37:43,626
Dora...

536
01:37:47,584 --> 01:37:49,876
- I have to go now.
- No!

537
01:37:50,084 --> 01:37:52,584
I'll come back,

538
01:37:52,792 --> 01:37:54,876
but remember,

539
01:37:55,084 --> 01:37:57,167
this has to be our secret.

540
01:37:57,376 --> 01:37:59,459
Not a word to anyone.

541
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,459
Dora, wait... Wait!

542
01:39:00,292 --> 01:39:02,792
The queen is my sister.

543
01:39:39,667 --> 01:39:41,959
No! No!

544
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:45,292
I have to stay here with my sister.

545
01:39:45,501 --> 01:39:47,584
Yes I'm sure she's our sister, <i>I</i>

546
01:39:47,792 --> 01:39:50,392
but it's time to go, the party is
over and the guests are leaving.

547
01:39:50,501 --> 01:39:53,626
I'm not a guest.
I'm the queen's sister.

548
01:39:53,834 --> 01:39:55,709
- Get up!
- No, I'm staying here.

549
01:39:55,917 --> 01:39:57,584
You are not listening to me, get up!

550
01:39:57,792 --> 01:40:00,292
- You may go now.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

551
01:40:00,501 --> 01:40:02,376
Dora, they want me to leave.

552
01:40:03,001 --> 01:40:04,876
What did I tell you?

553
01:40:05,084 --> 01:40:08,209
You have to keep quiet. Remember?

554
01:40:09,876 --> 01:40:12,584
- It's a secret.
- I want to be with you.

555
01:40:12,792 --> 01:40:14,876
You can't be with me.

556
01:40:15,292 --> 01:40:18,209
- Do you want me to lose everything?
- No.

557
01:40:18,417 --> 01:40:20,292
So you need to go.

558
01:40:25,709 --> 01:40:27,167
Go!

559
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:30,709
- I want to be with you.
- I said go!

560
01:40:37,167 --> 01:40:38,626
Go!

561
01:40:58,626 --> 01:41:00,251
Dora...

562
01:41:00,459 --> 01:41:02,792
I thought maybe I could sleep here.

563
01:41:03,001 --> 01:41:05,501
I'm tired of being alone.

564
01:41:05,709 --> 01:41:09,667
Listen to me, you can't stay here,
no one must see you, you have to go.

565
01:41:09,876 --> 01:41:13,001
- I want to be with you.
- And you can't.

566
01:41:13,209 --> 01:41:16,334
- Why?
- Take a look at yourself, Imma!

567
01:41:16,542 --> 01:41:18,626
You're old.

568
01:41:18,834 --> 01:41:20,917
No one would believe we are sisters.

569
01:41:21,751 --> 01:41:24,876
I want to become young too.
I want to.

570
01:41:25,084 --> 01:41:27,584
I want to! How did you do it?

571
01:41:27,792 --> 01:41:30,501
- I already told you, I don't know...
- No, tell me!

572
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:33,209
- You tell me!
- I changed my...

573
01:41:33,417 --> 01:41:36,126
I had myself flayed.
Now that's enough!

574
01:41:45,292 --> 01:41:47,376
Don't you dare move.

575
01:42:47,626 --> 01:42:50,751
- What? No!
- It's okay...

576
01:42:50,959 --> 01:42:53,042
Her, again!

577
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,084
Guards!

578
01:42:55,501 --> 01:42:57,376
Guards!

579
01:42:58,292 --> 01:43:00,167
- Guards!
- Calm down...

580
01:43:00,376 --> 01:43:03,292
- Guards!
- She's no one, I can explain.

581
01:43:03,501 --> 01:43:05,501
- Who is she?
- She's a neighbor...

582
01:43:05,709 --> 01:43:07,584
She's behind. Get her out!

583
01:43:08,626 --> 01:43:11,751
- Who is she?
- She won't do anything, please...

584
01:43:12,376 --> 01:43:14,876
- Take her out!
- Please, don't hurt her...

585
01:43:15,084 --> 01:43:17,584
What was she doing in my bedroom?
Out of my sight!

586
01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:20,292
Out of my sight!

587
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:22,959
No... no...

588
01:43:23,167 --> 01:43:26,126
I have to stay here, with my sister.

589
01:43:37,792 --> 01:43:40,709
Master barber, I have
something to ask you.

590
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:42,167
Tell me.

591
01:43:43,917 --> 01:43:46,001
Could you change my skin?

592
01:43:47,376 --> 01:43:49,042
Flay me.

593
01:43:49,459 --> 01:43:52,376
Why would you want to do that?

594
01:43:52,584 --> 01:43:54,876
Because I want to be young again.

595
01:43:55,501 --> 01:43:57,167
My dear...

596
01:43:58,376 --> 01:44:00,251
You will die.

597
01:44:00,459 --> 01:44:03,792
I can pay you, my sister's a queen.

598
01:44:04,876 --> 01:44:06,959
A queen?

599
01:44:07,792 --> 01:44:10,292
Well... then...

600
01:44:10,917 --> 01:44:13,001
You go tell the queen

601
01:44:13,417 --> 01:44:16,751
not to let you out on your own again.

602
01:44:18,417 --> 01:44:21,542
Come on, go back home.

603
01:44:39,876 --> 01:44:41,334
Sir...

604
01:44:42,584 --> 01:44:44,042
Sir...

605
01:44:48,626 --> 01:44:51,126
I have something to ask you.

606
01:44:51,334 --> 01:44:53,834
- What?
- Can you change my skin?

607
01:44:54,876 --> 01:44:58,417
- Change your skin?
- Flay me.

608
01:45:00,584 --> 01:45:02,876
- Flay you?
- I can pay you.

609
01:45:03,084 --> 01:45:06,126
My sister is the queen.

610
01:45:06,334 --> 01:45:07,376
Sir...

611
01:48:15,501 --> 01:48:16,959
Help!

612
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:24,459
Help me, please! Please!

613
01:48:24,667 --> 01:48:27,709
I'm being held prisoner by an ogre.

614
01:48:27,959 --> 01:48:30,292
You must have heard about me,
I'm a princess.

615
01:48:30,501 --> 01:48:33,417
The king's daughter who was given
in marriage to an ogre.

616
01:48:33,626 --> 01:48:36,126
I need you to help me
to get to the other side.

617
01:48:36,959 --> 01:48:39,876
Where is this ogre
that holds you prisoner?

618
01:48:40,084 --> 01:48:41,959
He's hunting but he will back in.

619
01:48:42,167 --> 01:48:45,084
I have to get across before he comes
back. You have to help me now.

620
01:48:53,417 --> 01:48:55,501
How can I help you?

621
01:49:00,709 --> 01:49:02,167
I'm sorry.

622
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:05,709
No! Please don't go!

623
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:10,917
I can't stay here!

624
01:49:11,959 --> 01:49:14,251
Please, stay!

625
01:49:16,126 --> 01:49:18,834
Please! Please!

626
01:49:28,001 --> 01:49:31,334
I have my sons,
they can save you.

627
01:49:31,542 --> 01:49:33,667
But you have to wait until tomorrow.

628
01:49:33,876 --> 01:49:37,001
No, I can't wait until tomorrow.

629
01:49:37,209 --> 01:49:40,042
Don't be afraid, trust me.
We'll come back tomorrow.

630
01:49:40,251 --> 01:49:44,834
No! Please, don't go!
Don't leave me, please!

631
01:51:56,126 --> 01:51:58,542
Violet!

632
01:53:57,167 --> 01:53:58,834
Mother!

633
01:59:40,292 --> 01:59:41,959
<i>Your majesty!</i>

634
01:59:42,584 --> 01:59:44,251
<i>Your majesty!</i>

635
01:59:45,292 --> 01:59:47,376
<i>Violet is here!</i>

636
01:59:47,792 --> 01:59:50,501
<i>The princess has returned!</i>

637
01:59:50,709 --> 01:59:54,251
<i>Your Majesty! Violet is here.</i>

638
01:59:56,959 --> 01:59:59,042
Violet has come home to us.

639
02:00:00,292 --> 02:00:04,251
Come, sir, It would do
your heart good to see her.

640
02:00:04,459 --> 02:00:06,584
Your Majesty, don't move.

641
02:00:06,792 --> 02:00:09,917
Please, Your Majesty...

642
02:00:12,584 --> 02:00:14,084
You are too weak...

643
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:23,626
Violet!

644
02:00:40,917 --> 02:00:44,042
Here is the husband
that you chose for me.

645
02:00:57,376 --> 02:00:59,459
Forgive me.

646
02:00:59,667 --> 02:01:02,792
Please, forgive me.

647
02:01:15,084 --> 02:01:17,167
Violet...
