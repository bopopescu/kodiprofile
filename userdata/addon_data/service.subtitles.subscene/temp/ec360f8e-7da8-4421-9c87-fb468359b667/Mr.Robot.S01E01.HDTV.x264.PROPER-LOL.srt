00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:39,947
but our business,
a cyber security firm

163
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,715
that protects corporations...

164
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:43,984
I can't think of anything
I hate more.

165
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:45,652
No, I love it here.

166
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:49,656
[both chuckle]

167
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:53,994
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:56,330
I'm just in a bad mood.

169
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:59,266
I'm late on my last
two student loan payments,

170
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:01,335
and I can't get Gideon
to give me a raise.

171
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:05,138
- Hey...
- Hi.

172
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,373
Yo, buddy.

173
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,375
Missed you last night.
Where were you?

174
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,911
Gotta go.
Big meeting today.

175
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,816
Did you find out
what happened?

176
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:17,351
Yeah. He said
he was working.

177
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:18,986
Oh, come on.
You gotta talk to him.

178
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:20,387
We're gonna be late
for the staff meeting.

179
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:23,724
He can't stand me.
And you know why.

180
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:26,126
Angela, I can't have
that kind of negativity

181
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:27,995
in my life.

182
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:31,198
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

183
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,677
(woman)
What are you thinking about?

184
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:46,813
Nothing.

185
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,718
You want to know
what I'm thinking about?

186
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,987
First time
you came to me.

187
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:56,189
(Elliot)
I didn't exactly
come to Krista.

188
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:58,291
I was forced here.
But I do like her.

189
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,127
Hacking her was simple.

190
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,729
Her password: Dylan 2791.

191
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:06,033
Favorite artist and the year in
which she was born, backwards.

192
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:07,434
Though she's a psychologist,

193
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:09,403
she's really bad
at reading people.

194
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:11,438
But I'm good at reading people.

195
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,942
My secret: I look for
the worst in them.

196
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:18,011
I know she went through
a divorce four years ago.

197
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:19,780
I know she was
devastated by it

198
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:22,716
and has been dating losers
on eHarmony ever since.

199
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:27,020
Her most recent foray...

200
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:28,889
Michael Hansen.

201
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:31,258
I searched for him online,
but nothing came up.

202
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
No LinkedIn, no Facebook,
nothing.

203
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:35,295
Something about him bugs me,

204
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:37,297
scratching that part
of my mind again.

205
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,933
But I'll hack him soon enough.
I always do.

206
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,401
I know you're not
yelling like before,

207
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:43,136
which is good.

208
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:46,039
But I can tell you're
still holding on to it.

209
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,475
And we need to work on
your anger issues, Elliot.

210
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:51,211
You're angry at everyone,
at society...

211
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,779
(Elliot)
F... society.

212
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:54,414
I know you have a lot
to be angry about,

213
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,083
but keeping it to yourself

214
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:57,417
and staying quiet
like you're doing...

215
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,853
It's not going to
help you.

216
00:11:59,855 --> 00:12:01,922
There's pain underneath.

217
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:04,458
That's where our work
needs to go.

218
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,465
What is it about society
that disappoints you so much?

219
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:18,338
[tense music]

220
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,407
Oh, I don't know.

221
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:23,410
Is it that we collectively
thought Steve Jobs

222
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:25,378
was a great man,
even when we knew

223
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,516
he made billions off the backs
of children?

224
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:32,119
Or maybe it's that it feels
like all our heroes

225
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:34,054
are counterfeit.

226
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:37,124
The world itself's
just one big hoax.

227
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,026
Spamming each other

228
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,262
with our running commentary
of bullshit

229
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:44,831
masquerading as insight,
our social media

230
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,000
faking as intimacy.

231
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:50,370
Or is it that we voted
for this?

232
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:52,506
Not with our rigged
elections,

233
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:55,442
but with our things,
our property, our money.

234
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:57,010
I'm not saying
anything new.

235
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,879
We all know why
we do this,

236
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:01,114
<i>not because Hunger Games
books makes us happy</i>

237
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:03,884
but because
we wanna be sedated.

238
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:05,519
Because it's painful
not to pretend,

239
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:09,022
because we're cowards.

240
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:10,557
F... society.

241
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,992
[Krista, echoing]
Elliot.

242
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:13,193
[normal voice]
Elliot.

243
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:15,929
You're not saying
anything.

244
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:18,031
What's wrong?

245
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:20,333
Nothing.

246
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:25,572
Don't be frustrated.

247
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:28,575
Why shouldn't I be?

248
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:32,546
You're different
than most.

249
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:35,415
You at least try.

250
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:38,051
You at least
understand.

251
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:41,121
Understand what?

252
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:44,090
What it's like
to feel alone.

253
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:48,562
You understand the pain.

254
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:51,264
You want to protect
people from it.

255
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:53,967
You want to protect me
from it.

256
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,271
I respect that
about you.

257
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:04,277
Why do you think
I know

258
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,846
what it's like
to feel alone?

259
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:08,215
(Elliot)
Shit! From her emails!

260
00:14:08,217 --> 00:14:09,950
Elliot?

261
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:12,152
I don't know.

262
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:16,590
Let's talk about
last night.

263
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:19,359
Did you go to Angela's
birthday party?

264
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:24,130
[pop music playing]

265
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:26,867
Yeah. It was nice.

266
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:29,569
Did you try to talk
to anyone?

267
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,304
Sure.

268
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:33,373
I got a girl's number.

269
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,275
- You did?
- [chuckles]

270
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:37,210
She's cute.

271
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:40,013
<i>She likes
The Hunger Games.</i>

272
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:47,120
You're hiding again,
Elliot.

273
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,092
When you hide,
your delusions come back.

274
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:54,394
It's a slippery slope.

275
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:59,666
Let's talk about the men
in black you've been seeing.

276
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:01,501
Are they still there?

277
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,574
No, I...
told you they're gone.

278
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:10,510
The meds you gave me
are working.

279
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:17,584
Yo, man.

280
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:19,185
Do you wanna, uh...

281
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:21,187
you wanna do lunch
today?

282
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:22,589
Uh, yeah...

283
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:25,025
- I got other plans.
- Other plans. Right.

284
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:28,595
That's... what you said the last
three times I asked you.

285
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:31,031
Look, bud, you...

286
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,066
and Angela
have been close

287
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:36,002
for a long time,
and that's even more reason

288
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:38,438
why I want us to be
on good terms.

289
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,174
I-I just... I feel like
things have been

290
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:44,277
awkward between us.
Don't you?

291
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,680
I'm okay with it
being awkward between us.

292
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:49,049
[laughs]
Um, yeah.

293
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:52,152
I-I'm... I'm not
okay with that.

294
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:55,121
Um... look, man,
I love Angela,

295
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:58,725
and I want us to...
To get along for her sake.

296
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:01,594
I mean, that's what I'm...
That's what I'm here for.

297
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:03,730
I just, I...
I don't normally do stuff...

298
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:06,232
(Elliot)
Am I crazy not to like this guy?

299
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:08,368
Among some of
his Facebook likes

300
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,370
are George W. Bush's
Decision Points,

301
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,739
<i>Transformers 2:
Revenge of the Fallen,</i>

302
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,208
and the music of Josh Groban.

303
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,744
Must I really justify myself
any further?

304
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:19,479
I'm working on
that shit, you know?

305
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:25,318
His was the easiest to hack.
Password was 123456Seven.

306
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,988
I witnessed his first
"I love you" with Angela

307
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,190
over Gchat,

308
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:31,758
then I witnessed the first
of many infidelities

309
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,426
with Stella B.

310
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:36,763
I've never done
anything like this before...

311
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:39,099
I've thought about
telling Angela,

312
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,467
but she has shitty taste
in men,

313
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:41,735
and I'm not quite ready

314
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:43,336
to see what comes after this
just yet.

315
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:44,504
You like music.
I like music.

316
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,072
Maroon 5.

317
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:48,274
Plus I can manage Ollie
easier than the others.

318
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,743
For now, anyway.

319
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,478
And that's all I mean.
[sighs]

320
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,079
I just want you
to know that.

and everyone you care about.

804
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,224
What are you talking about?

805
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:31,930
Money.

806
00:45:31,932 --> 00:45:35,333
Money hasn't been real since we
got off the gold standard.

807
00:45:35,335 --> 00:45:38,036
It's become virtual.
Software.

808
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:41,339
The operating system
of our world.

809
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:44,409
And, Elliot,
we are on the verge

810
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:48,813
of taking down
this virtual reality.

811
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:51,416
Think about it.

812
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:56,187
What if you could take down
one conglomerate?

813
00:45:56,189 --> 00:45:59,791
A conglomerate
so deeply entrenched

814
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:01,426
in the world's economy,

815
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,428
that too big to fail
doesn't even come close

816
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,163
to describing it.

817
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:07,799
You want to create
another financial meltdown

818
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:11,035
like the one we just had,
but way worse.

819
00:46:11,037 --> 00:46:13,037
Yeah, why would
I want that?

820
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,372
Everyone would lose
their money.

821
00:46:14,374 --> 00:46:16,141
What if I told you
that this conglomerate

822
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:17,542
just so happens to own

823
00:46:17,544 --> 00:46:19,778
70% of the global
consumer credit industry?

824
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,112
Huh?

825
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:22,814
If we hit their data center
just right,

826
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:25,150
we could systematically format
all the servers,

827
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:27,051
- including backup.
- That would erase all...

828
00:46:27,053 --> 00:46:29,387
All the debt we owe them.

829
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:32,557
Every record of every
credit card, loan, and mortgage

830
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,126
would be wiped clean.

831
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:36,361
It would be impossible
to reinforce

832
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:37,829
outdated paper records.

833
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:40,865
It would all be gone.

834
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:43,468
The single biggest incident

835
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:47,539
of wealth redistribution
in history.

836
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:57,415
Evil Corp.
The conglomerate.

837
00:46:57,417 --> 00:46:59,317
That's why you
picked me.

838
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:00,885
Because I work
at AllSafe.

839
00:47:00,887 --> 00:47:04,055
Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to
get a visit

840
00:47:04,057 --> 00:47:08,126
from the FBI
and the U.S. Cyber Command.

841
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:12,564
You are going to modify
the dat file

842
00:47:12,566 --> 00:47:17,402
and put Colby's
terminal IP address in there.

843
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:20,038
Terry Colby?

844
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,175
You're gonna frame him?
No one's gonna believe that.

845
00:47:24,177 --> 00:47:26,477
I met him, he's a moron.

846
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:28,346
So are the FBI.

847
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:30,081
Even if they don't believe
he did it,

848
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:33,484
they'll believe
he gave someone access to it.

849
00:47:33,486 --> 00:47:35,053
Yeah, he'll just go to jail.

850
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:36,321
What good will that do?

851
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:37,956
You don't take down
a conglomerate

852
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,891
by shooting them
in the heart.

853
00:47:39,893 --> 00:47:41,459
That's the thing
about conglomerates,

854
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:43,461
they don't have hearts.

855
00:47:43,463 --> 00:47:46,231
You take them down
limb by limb.

856
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:47,632
And as they unravel,

857
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:50,902
their illusion
of control unravels.

858

859
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:01,880
That'll come later.

860
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:06,517
Right now, you have a lot
to think about.

861
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:09,153
You have to change
the dat file

and put Colby's IP
in there.

863
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,428
You do that,

864
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,597
you have set in motion
the largest revolution

at 2:35 and I instru...

Why didn't anyone pipe in
from their laptops?

934
00:51:52,312 --> 00:51:55,113
- It's not protocol...
- It wouldn't have been secure

935
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:58,516
if someone terminaled in
on this.

936
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:02,220
It was the smarter move
to have someone come in

937
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:04,155
so they can log in
on a secure line.

Hello.

Hi, this is Sam from Bank of E
security fraud department.

966

Unfortunately
I have to inform you

been compromised.

(Michael)
What? What happened?

969
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,866
First before I can
answer any questions,

00:54:57,868 --> 00:54:59,368

some information.

(Michael)
Yes. Apartment 2C.

And your security question,

Um, Yankees.

I don't remember this
being a security question.

00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,715
And lastly, your pet's name?

978
00:55:12,717 --> 00:55:14,984
(Michael)
Um, Flipper.
