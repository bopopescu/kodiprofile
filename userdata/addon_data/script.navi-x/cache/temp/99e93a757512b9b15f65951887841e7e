description=George Denis Patrick Carlin was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, actor and author, who won five Grammy Awards for his comedy albums. Carlin was noted for his black humor as well as his thoughts on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo subjects. Carlin and his "Seven Dirty Words" comedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a narrow 5Ã¢ÂÂ4 decision by the justices affirmed the government's power to regulate indecent material on the public airwaves. The first of his fourteen stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. In the 1990s and 2000s, Carlin's routines focused on socio-cultural criticism of modern American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of American culture. His final HBO special, It's Bad for Ya, was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2004, Carlin placed second on the Comedy Central list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ahead of Lenny Bruce and behind Richard Pryor. He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live. In 2008, he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor./description

description=US-born actor, director, writer, musician, and composer best known for his hilarious mockumentaries, poking fun at heavy metal music, small town theater, dog shows and folk music. Christopher Haden-Guest was born February 5th, 1948, in New York City to an American mother and a British father, Peter Haden-Guest, the fourth Baron of Saling in the County of Essex.



He received his dramatic arts training at New York CityÃ??Ã?Â¢Ã??Ã??Ã??Ã??s High School of Arts and Music and at Bard College, and Guest first appeared in minor film roles in a mixture of film genres including The Hot Rock (1972), Death Wish (1974), Lemmings (1973) (V), and The Long Riders (1980). However, he was also dabbling in writing for several TV shows, and when filming Million Dollar Infield (1982) (TV), Guest became acquainted with writer-director Rob Reiner and the two collaborated, along with Michael McKean and Harry Shearer, to pen the script and music for the sleeper hit This Is Spinal Tap (1984).



The mockumentary also starred Guest as dizzy lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel, whose most famous line is surely, Ã??Ã?Â¢Ã??Ã??Ã??Ã??These go to eleven,Ã??Ã?Â¢Ã??Ã??Ã??Ã?Ã?ï¿½ when referring to the volume settings on the bandÃ??Ã?Â¢Ã??Ã??Ã??Ã??s rather unique Marshall amplifiers!



Guest then busied himself for several years in the 1980Ã??Ã?Â¢Ã??Ã??Ã??Ã??s as a regular performer on Saturday Night Live (1975) and, along with fellow Spinal Tap band members lead singer David St. Hubbins, aka Michael McKean; and bassist Derek Smalls, aka Harry Shearer, they regularly appeared as Spinal Tap. In 1992, they released Spinal Tap: Break Like the Wind Ã??Ã?Â¢Ã??Ã??Ã??Ã?? The Videos (1992) (V), plus A Spinal Tap Reunion: The 25th Anniversary London Sell-Out (1992) (TV).



Guest had a minor acting role in the courtroom drama of A Few Good Men (1992), before returning to poke fun at wannabe actors in the howlingly funny Waiting for Guffman (1996) with Guest taking center stage as high-strung choreographer Corky St. Clair. He made a return to heavy metal with Spinal Tap: The Final Tour (1998) (V) and Catching Up with Marty DiBergi (2000) (V) before turning his comedic pen to the world of championship dog shows for the sensational comedy Best in Show (2000). The latest mockumentary from Guest and co-writer-actor Eugene Levy was again met with critical praise, and movie fans just loved it, too! In 2003, Guest and Eugene Levy took aim at the folk-music world, and successfully collaborated to write the comedy A Mighty Wind (2003) about the reunion of the Folksmen, a fictional 1960s folk music group.



Guest is married to well-known actress Jamie Lee Curtis with two children, Annie Guest and Thomas, plus he is the brother of actor Nicholas Guest./description

URL=http://www.navixtreme.com/playlist/157595/human_remains_(2000)_(tv_series).plx
description=Human Remains is a British black comedy television series written by and starring Rob Brydon and Julia Davis. It consisted of six episodes that aired in 2000. Each episode documented the relationship of a different couple, all of whom were played by Brydon and Davis and all but two of whom were extremely unhappy, in the style of a fly on the wall documentary. In 2009, The Guardian called it "one of the best comedies in the past ten years".[1]

Much of the show's humour is derived from very bleak ideas and situations. Domestic violence, chronic depression and death all feature prominently throughout the six episodes. Julia Davis later used some of these themes in her solo project, Nighty Night. Ruth Jones, who would later work with Davis in Nighty Night, appears in the third episode. She would later co-write the acclaimed series Gavin and Stacey, in which both Brydon and Davis would star./description

Combination comedy/romance/thriller. Charlie is a hip bookstore owner with a commitment problem. When he finally falls in love with a butcher, he comes to suspect she's a serial killer and he's in line as her next victim. "Saturday Night Live" star Myers has a dual role: as Charlie and as Scottish dad Stuart, allowing him to be fanatically Scottish as Stuart and somewhat more restrained as the angst-ridden Charlie. One-gag movie counted on Myers' "Wayne's World" popularity, which didn't pan out at the boxoffice. Best appreciated by Myers' fans, this one is better on the small screen./description

Destined to become one of the top movies of all time--Not! This "Saturday Night Live" skit proved to be so popular that it got its own movie, not unlike the plot, which has slimy producer Benjamin Oliver (Lowe) take the public access "Wayne's World" into the world of commercial television. The zany duo of Wayne (Myers) and Garth (Carvey) are as much fun on the big screen as they were on SNL and there are many funny moments, several of which are destined to become comedy classics. A huge boxoffice hit that spawned a sequel. It also spawned Lorne Michaels's desperate attempts to match its success with other non-bigscreen worthy skits from the show./description

description=The Waterboy is a 1998 American comedy film directed by Frank Coraci. It stars Adam Sandler alongside Henry Winkler, Kathy Bates, Jerry Reed, and Fairuza Balk. Lynn Swann, Lawrence Taylor, Jimmy Johnson, Bill Cowher, Paul Wight, and Rob Schneider have cameos. Sandler produced the movie and co-wrote the script with Tim Herlihy.

The movie was extremely profitable, earning over $160 million in the United States alone and made Sandler a successful actor with The Waterboy becoming his second $100 million film in a year, along with The Wedding Singer.

Sandler's character, Bobby Boucher (pronounced "Boo-SHAY"), bears a strong resemblance to his "The Excited Southerner" comedic skits from his album "What the Hell Happened to Me?" The portrayal is one of a stereotypical Cajun from swamps of South Louisiana, not the typical stereotype of a Southerner. He also shares similarities in speech and mannerism to Canteen Boy, a recurring character, also portrayed by Adam Sandler, on Saturday Night Live.[1] Like Bobby, Canteen Boy preferred "purified water, right out of the old canteen", which he always carried with him.

-=Plot=-
Bobby Boucher is a socially inept (but also intelligent), stuttering  water boy with hidden anger issues due to constant teasing and his mother's (Kathy Bates) excessive sheltering. He was the water boy for the University of Louisiana Cougars[2]  for the past 18 years, but the players tormented him, and the team's head coach, Coach Red Beaulieu, (Jerry Reed) fired him for "disrupting" his team's practices. After unsuccessfully attempting to become the new waterboy of his favorite wrestler, Captain Insano (Paul Wight), he approaches Coach Klein (Henry Winkler), of the South Central Louisianaa State University Mud Dogs, and volunteers to work as the team's water boy for free after seeing the filthy water that the coach provides his players.

During his first few hours of being waterboy for the Mud Dogs, one of the players upsets Bobby. Coach Klein notices Bobby's powerful potential and encourages him to stand up for himself. After the team's quarterback, Gee Grenouille (Peter Dante), taunts Bobby, he sees flashes of the people that have taunted and hurt him over the years. In a rage, Bobby runs onto the field and, with force beyond his average size, tackles Grenouille. This prompts Coach Klein to put Bobby on the team, where he uses his anger to tackle the opposing players by pretending they're the people who made fun of him throughout his life. He quickly becomes one of the most feared linebackers in college football and, despite his overprotective mother's disapproval, he secretly continues to play football, attends school, and begins dating a local girl named Vicki Vallencourt (Fairuza Balk). The Mud Dogs play so well with Bobby on the team that they make it to the Bourbon Bowl against the Cougars.

During their victory celebration, Coach Beaulieu and his team show up with Bobby's high school transcript, which turns out to be fake, making Bobby ineligible for college and football. Coach Klein tells Bobby that he can continue to play on the team, if he takes and passes a GED exam. He also admits it was him that forged Bobby's transcript so that he could play. He then tells Bobby of how twenty years ago, when Klein and Beaulieu were assistant coaches at UL, Beaulieu bullied him out of his green notebook in which he wrote down all his foolproof play ideas, enabling Beaulieu to get the job as coach for the Cougars over Klein. This inspires Bobby to study for the exam and to help get Coach Klein's playbook, and confidence, back. When Bobby's mom sees him studying for the exam, she is shocked and infuriated to learn that he has been playing football and going to school behind her back. Fed up, Bobby tells her he's had enough of her and storms out. On the day of the exam, Bobby passes, but shortly after, the Parish Sheriff arrives and tells Bobby that his mother is in the hospital after falling ill.

Bobby arrives at the hospital where, unbeknownst him, Mama is faking her illness. After Bobby laments on her condition, she reveals to him why she's faking her illness and explains why she's been so determined to keep him close to her: Many years ago, Bobby's father went to New Orleans to find work. There, he fell in love with an attractive "voodoo woman" named Phyllis, changed his name to Roberto, and ran off with her. Ever since, she's been afraid Bobby would leave her too. She now realizes she's treated Bobby unfairly and reconciles with him. They leave the hospital and head to the stadium, but don't arrive until halftime. By this point, the Cougars have built a fairly large lead on the Mud Dogs. Bobby walks into the locker room and inspires the team to make a second half comeback, finally gaining the acceptance of his teammates. To counter Bobby's return, Coach Beaulieu adopts a scorched earth tactic, kneeling on the ball three times each series of downs and punting away to the Mud Dogs, neutralizing Bobby's tackling ability and forcing the Mud Dogs' struggling offense to win the game for them. Bobby is able to help Coach Klein overcome his fear of Coach Beaulieu, which allows him to design brilliant new plays that Beaulieu is unable to counter. The Mud Dogs then rally to within a field goal late in the game. Coach Klein decides to use Bobby as a two way threat, first using him for an onside kick (which he recovers) and then calling a halfback option pass play for Bobby, who throws a touchdown pass to give the Mud Dogs the win.

Sometime later, Bobby and Vicki are getting married. On their way out Bobby's father makes an unexpected appearance. He tries to convince Bobby to leave school to go to the NFL, hoping to personally profit as his father; but, Mama comes charging at him and tackles him while Bobby and Vicki leave./description

Now washed up, he attempts to reinvent himself as a director by staging a new retelling of a classic Broadway dramatic play called "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love".
