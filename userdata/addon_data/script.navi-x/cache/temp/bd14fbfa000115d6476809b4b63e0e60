[COLOR red] thankyou all for your support over the last couple of months its a sad
 day for me because im going to have to take a break
 from updating my list,ive recently been going through some health problems so 
im unable to continue working and updating my list  im so sorry about that but at 
the moment im to ill to do anything at the moment, the good news is you still have
 other options such as dexter tv and many other great addons,theres also hammy list here on navi x
 who always tries his best to keep his list updated  but as you guys no  ,it can be
 become a battle for working links to stay active i will keep what i have active 
and hope most links last,the movie and tv shows should last a while as its on a
 paid server.again thankyou all for your support .all the best

description=James Gunn's PG Porn is a web series created by the brothers James Gunn, Brian Gunn, and Sean Gunn. It consists of a series of pornography spoofs, with a humorous event occurring just before the supposed commencement of sexual acts. Each episode pairs a mainstream actor with a pornographic actress or model. The tagline is, "For people who love everything about Porn...except the sex."
The initial episode premiered on Spike.com and received over a million hits in a week, and was featured on Entertainment Weekly's The Must List. Spike subsequently picked up the series for an additional 11 episodes.
The project has, however, not been without controversy. The Huffington Post condemned the first episode for glorifying violence against women.
According to James, they developed the idea in the early 2000s, before short-term Internet-based sketch comedies became popular. Stephen Blackehart of The Good Boys Productions produced the show with Jake Zim and Peter Safran of Safran Digital Group (SDG) for Spike.com.
