00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,047
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
My home is District 12.

00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,371
I was in the Hunger Games.

You can't be in here.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,442
I had a nightmare.
Just five more minutes.

WOMAN: You need to sleep.
We can help you sleep.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,290

but I, uh...

22

I couldn't move.

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,123
They have Annie, too.
They took her.

24

She's, uh... (SNIFFLING)

She's in the Capitol.

I wish she was dead.

27

dead and we were, too.

Colonel Boggs,
District 13's head of security.

I know you've been discharged,

31
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,841
but President Coin's
requested to meet with you first.

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,883
Is there any news?

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,928
BOGGS: I'm just here to escort you.

34
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,890
We were always told
there was nothing left of 13.

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,561
BOGGS: Capitol bombed
the surface to rubble.

36
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,003
But we're military,
so we learned to survive down here.

37

Preparing, training.

38
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,484
The war never stopped for us.

41
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,046
Madam President,
may I present you with The Mockingjay.

42
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,527
What an honor it is to meet you.

43
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,685
You're a courageous young woman.

44
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,400
I know how disorienting this must be.

45
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,327
And I can't imagine
what it's like to live through
the atrocities of those Games.

46
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,606
Katniss,

47
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,444
President Alma Coin.

48
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,290
Please know how welcome you are.

49
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,007
I hope you'll find
some comfort with us.

50
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,487
We've known loss in 13, too.

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,529
PLUTARCH: This is history.
Right here at this table.

52
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
PRESIDENT COIN: I apologize.

53
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,960
I wish you had more time to recover,
but unfortunately,
we don't have that luxury.

54
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,485
Please, have a seat.

55
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,251
Are you aware of what's happened?

56
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,285
When you fired your
arrow at the force field

57
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,328
you electrified the nation.

58
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,242
There have been riots and uprisings
and strikes in seven districts.

59
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,085
We believe that if we keep
this energy going we can unify
the districts against the Capitol.

60
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,050
But if we don't, if we let it dissipate,

61
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,124
we could be waiting
another 75 years for this opportunity.

62
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,202
Everyone in 13 is ready for this.

63
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,089
What about Peeta?
Is he alive?

64
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,130
I don't know.
And I wish that I did.

65
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,248
But there's no way for me to contact
my operatives inside the Capitol.

66
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,126
BEETEE: The Capitol has always suppressed
communication between the districts.

67
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,488
But I know their system very well.

68
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,846
I managed to break through.

69
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,401
All we need now is
the perfect message.

70
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,721
PLUTARCH: Katniss,
here's what we need to do.

71
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,485
We need to show them
that The Mockingjay's alive and well

72
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,325
and willing to stand up
and join this fight.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,483
'Cause we need every district
to stand up to this Capitol.

74
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,164
The way you did.

75
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,927
So we're gonna
shoot a series of propaganda clips,

76
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,884
propos, I like to call them,

77
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,371
on The Mockingjay.

78
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,283
Spreads the word

79
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,091
that we're gonna
stoke the fire of this rebellion.

80
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,970
The fire that The Mockingjay started.

81
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,202
(SOFTLY) You left him there.

82
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,411
- You left Peeta in that arena to die.
- Katniss, there are so many...

83
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,289
Peeta was the one
who was supposed to live.

84
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,407
Miss Everdeen.

85
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,330
This revolution is about everyone.

86
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,243
It's about all of us.

87
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,130
And we need a voice.

88
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,521
Then you should've saved Peeta.

89
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,883
Maybe you should have
rescued the boy instead.

90
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,680
Oh, no.

91
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,530
No, listen to me.
No one else can do this but her.

92
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,728
This is not the girl you described.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,844
Obviously, we need to make it personal.

94
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,490
Remind her who the real enemy is.

95
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,403
She knows who the enemy is.
That's not the issue.

96
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,403
Unless she's forgotten.

97
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,131
There's explaining and there's showing.

98
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,526
Let her see what
the Capitol did to 12.

99
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,685
She can't handle it.
The Games destroyed her.

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,401
This is the only choice you have.

101
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,128
People don't always show up
the way you want them to, Madam President.

102
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,331
But that anger, that anger-driven
defiance, that's what we want.
And we can redirect it.

103
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,369
We need to unite
these people out there

104
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,050
that have been doing nothing
but killing each other

in an arena for years.

106
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,361
We have to have a lightning rod.

107
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,728
They'll follow her.
She's the face of the revolution.

108
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,723
Let her see it.
Let her go home.

109
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,846
Send her.

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,645
You will hold yourself
and your government responsible

317
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,041
or you will find another Mockingjay.

318
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,851
That's it. That's her.
Right there.

319
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,483
Isn't that who I promised you?

320
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,449
She wears the costume.

321
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,205
Gunfire in the background.
A hint of smoke.

322
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,850
Our Mockingjay.

323
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,766
Madam President, we're losing ground,
because the people are losing heart.

324
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,001
This is worth the risk.

325
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,844
She's worth the risk.

326
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,366
Pardons, tribunals.
Power of the people.

327
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,966
It can all be the bedrock
of the new Panem, but,

328
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,687
in wartime I think even
the noblest of causes
can be bent a little bit. Right?

329
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,766
Do you have any other conditions?

330
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,481
My sister gets to keep her cat.

331
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,647
EFFIE: Go away.

332
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,130
(EFFIE SIGHING)

333
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,802
Is it visiting hours again?

334
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,805
Miss Trinket,

335
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,844
you see this door.

336
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,806
It opens.
From the inside.

337
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,808
I've told you, these are the standard
living quarters. Same as everyone.

338
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,691
You're not a prisoner.
You're free to join the rest of 13.

339
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,246
Not looking like this.
Thank you very much.

340
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,403
We have a bigger issue
than wardrobe, Miss Trinket.

341
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,209
Katniss has agreed
to be The Mockingjay.

342
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,691
(SIGHING) That poor thing.

343
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,411
And your Girl on
Fire is burnt out.

344
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,767
I need you to
join this team now.

345
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,043
I need someone she trusts.

346
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,724
What about Haymitch?

347
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,650
He's drying out in
some facility a mile down.

348
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,321
Aiding rebels is
not really my forte.

349
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,803
Miss Trinket, your days
in the Capitol are over,

350
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,248
no matter what happens here.

351
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,924
If you wanna play
a prisoner of war, fine.

352
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,604
Stay here and rot.

353
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,961
I'll find someone else
to be The Mockingjay's escort.

354
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,281
Who?

355
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,925
(SCOFFS) Anyone can be replaced.

356
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,044
Not your Mockingjay.

357
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,721
There isn't a soul in this dungeon
who knows the first thing about Katniss.

358
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,931
You honestly believe
one of these cave dwellers

359
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,002
is going to take my place?

360
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,166
No.

361
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,725
Good afternoon.

362
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,721
Thank you for interrupting your schedules.

363
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,922
<i>They have already
been adjusted to compensate for the delay.</i>

364
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,640
I hardly ever see children around here.

365
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,808
<i>Please, check in with your unit supervisors
when you resume work.</i>

366
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,645
A lot of them were
lost in an epidemic a few years ago.

367
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,006
<i>I have an announcement
for the citizens of 13.</i>

368
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,570
Coin lost her family, too.

369
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,565
Daughter and a husband.

370
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,007
<i>And our welcome guests from 12.</i>

371
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,325
Katniss Everdeen has consented
to be the face of our cause

372
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,169
to help unite the districts
against the Capitol.

373
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,126
In exchange, I have promised
several concessions.

374
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,682
First, we'll assess all opportunities
for the extraction of the Victors

375
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,442
held hostage in the Capitol.

376
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,761
Peeta Mellark...

377
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,285
(CLAMORING)

378
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,525
Johanna Mason...

379
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,531
Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too.

380
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,489
...and Annie Cresta.

381
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,966
Once freed,

382
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,964
they will be granted full pardon
for any and all crimes

383
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,451
committed against the rebel cause.

384
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,971
(ALL SHOUTING DISAGREEMENT)

385
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,081
Good.

386
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,484
That's good, Katniss.

387
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,485
If Katniss Everdeen fails
to fulfill her duties

388
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,644
the deal will be off.

389
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,729
Thank you for your attention.

390
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,326
Please, resume your daily schedules.

391
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,247
PLUTARCH: Madam President.

392
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,526
Effie Trinket.

393
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,171
Welcome to 13.

394
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,484
PLUTARCH: Madam President,
may I say you are so very

395
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,890
- concise.
- EFFIE: Mmm.

396
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,210
You believe that
there's more to be said?

397
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,881
May I speak freely?

398
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,849
You don't appear to
do anything else.

399
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,211
I'm only talking about salesmanship.

400
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,208
The thing with revolutions,
they're a tender flame.

401
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,169
They need to be nurtured
with a little kindling

402
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,561
and warmth.

403
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,241
Bit of oxygen.

404
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,685
Oxygen.

405
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,846
One sure way to put
it out is to smother it.

406
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,605
Or to use up all
the air in the room.

407
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,045
Excuse me.

408
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,321
You know what could use
a revolution? That hair.

409
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,801
KATNISS: Effie?

410
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,361
Oh!

411
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,005
What are you doing here?

412
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,651
I'm a political refugee.

413
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,811
Plutarch rescued you?

414
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,042
Rescued, yes, that's what he calls it.

415
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,206
You and I were both in the dark.

416
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,046
Now I'm condemned
to this life of jumpsuits.

417
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,401
It is wonderful to see you again.

418
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,808
Can you believe this place?

419
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,804
I miss coffee.

420
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,971
I never knew anyplace
could be so strict.

421
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,329
I mean, I thought at least
in the higher ranks there'd be some

422
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,930
side action.

423
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,243
I miss my wigs.

424
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,322
Luckily, I remembered
that this was all the rage

425
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,004
when I was coming up.

426
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,163
You know, everything old
can be made new again.

427
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,850
Like democracy.

428
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,489
Which brings me to this.

431
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,409
He's dead, isn't he?

432
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,005
Yes, dear.

433
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,686
He made Plutarch promise
not to show you this

434
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,650
until you'd decided
to be The Mockingjay on your own.

435
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,363
He knew the risks.
As we all do.

436
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,291
He believed in this revolution.

437
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,884
He believed in you.

438
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,644
They're beautiful.

439
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,405
They have it.

440
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,281
They have the Mockingjay outfit.

441
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,441
There's not much of
a prep team here in 13

No. He warned me.
He warned me about this.

He's doing this because
I'm The Mockingjay.

Not The Mockingjay.
Just Katniss.

You're unbelievable.

Okay, but I meant what I said. (SIGHING)

they're rescuing Peeta.

What?

1165
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,121
The dam went down in District 5,
took out most of the power to the Capitol.

1166

Knocked out their signal defense.

1167

Beetee's inside their system now,
wreaking all kinds of havoc.

1168
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,280
A window is open to us.

How much longer?
I don't know.

1170
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,291
I guess until the Capitol
can get the power back on.

1171
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,600
And President Coin?

1172
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,729
You know, I can never
fully support that woman

1173
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,840
in light of the prohibition
they have going on around this place,

1174
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,611
but Plutarch got word

1175
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,286
that Peeta and the others
are in the Tribute Center.

1176
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,683
And with the power out,
Coin sees this as an opportunity.

1177
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,530
She knows that Peeta

1178
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,001
is the Capitol's weapon.
The same way you're ours.

1179
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,562
And as opposed to having you two
pointing at each other,

1180
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,644
she's going to get him.

1181
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,521
I have to go help.

Wait.

gonna jump outta the vent

1184
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,246

1185

Besides, it's already underway.

1186
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,409
Six soldiers went in.
Volunteer only.

1187

- Yeah. Yeah.

1424
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:09,886
HAYMITCH: Peeta!

1425
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,723
Peeta! Get off!
Get off of her!

1426
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,202
Let go! (GRUNTING)

1427
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,363
(MONITOR BEEPING)

1428
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,411
(GASPING)

1429
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,687
No, Katniss.
No, you're swollen. Don't touch.

1430
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,565
No, no, no.
Calm down.

1431
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,250
Calm down.
You're okay.

1432
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,685
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

1433
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,966
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

1434
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,611
Tell her she's awake.

1435
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,690
- Don't try to talk.
- (STAMMERING)

1436
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,285
Peeta's okay.
I promise.

1437
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,965
I just had to get him off you.

1438
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,521
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1439
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,042
It's called hijacking.

1440
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,284
We don't know how long
the Capitol's been doing this to Peeta.

1441
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,770
It's fear conditioning.

1442
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:26,808
Enhanced with tracker jacker venom.

1443
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,602
You were stung your first Games.
Remember?

1444
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,689
The venom puts the subject
in a dissociative state.

1445
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,602
And they torture him.

1446
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:41,681
With shocks and beatings,
and strip down his identity.

1447
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,650
And then all of that
suffering and fear is redirected.

1448
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,327
Associated with other
memories or a person.

1449
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,444
They can change
his memories of Katniss?

1450
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,320
To make her seem
life-threatening.

1451
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,082
HAYMITCH: They turned him
into a weapon, Katniss.

1452
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,491
To kill you.

1453
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:01,961
But you can reverse it?

1454
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,080
The fear is the most
difficult thing to overcome.

1455
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:06,885
We're hardwired to remember fear best.

1456
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,644
It's new terrain.

1457
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,842
But we've put together a team.

1458
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,842
I'm optimistic.

1459
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,281
(CROWD CHEERING)

1460
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,720
Good evening.

1461
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,724
Yesterday, I authorized

1462
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:48,963
a covert rescue mission
inside the Capitol.

1463
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,966
I am pleased to announce

1464
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:55,090
that the Victors have been liberated!

1465
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:05,651
<i>Let this day mark
an historic change.</i>

1466
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:10,002
<i>With The Mockingjay
and the Victors beside us,</i>

1467
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,527
<i>we have sent a clear
message to the Capitol.</i>

1468
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:17,401
That we will never
again endure injustice.

1469
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,404
(CHEERING)

1470
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,571
Today,

1471
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:28,008
a day on which we reunited family,

1472
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,926
friends, and loved ones.

1473
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:35,526
<i>Let all of Panem come together.</i>

1474
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:40,480
<i>Not to battle
for the amusement of the Capitol.</i>

1475
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,564
<i>But to join hands in this fight.</i>

1476
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,649
(CHEERING)

1477
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:53,126
Let today be
the day we promise

1478
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:56,921
never to give up,
never to give in

1479
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,004
until we have
made a new Panem,

1480
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:03,846
where leaders are elected,
not imposed upon us.

1481
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,568
And where the districts are free

1482
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,961
to share the fruits of their labors

1483
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,361
and not fight one another for scraps!

1484
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,563
(CROWD CHEERING)

1485
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,529
This new Panem is on the horizon.

1486
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,128
But we must take
it for ourselves.

1487
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:34,484
<i>The road there
leads through the sharp mountains</i>

1488
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,683
<i>and deep ravines of District 2.</i>

1489
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,842
<i>There in the heart</i>

1490
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,571
<i>of Panem's steepest
mountain range lies</i>

1491
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:45,849
the Capitol's principal military facility.

1492
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:49,241
<i>We can conquer this stronghold</i>

1493
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,724
because we are one people,

1494
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:56,607
one army, one voice.

1495
01:49:56,720 --> 01:50:01,248
<i>Because today is our new beginning.</i>

1496
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:05,525
Today we have freed the Victors.

1497
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:09,169
Tomorrow, Panem!

1498
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:21,604
ALL: (CHANTING) Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

1499
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:25,524
(INAUDIBLE)

1500
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,042
(APPLAUSE)
