3
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,530
Boys, let's do this!

4
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,830
Gray?

5
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,930
Honey, what are you doing?

6
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,850
What is this here? Let's go.

7
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,910
Come on, honey.
Your flight's in two hours.

8
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,190
Dane County Airport is 36 minutes away,
60 with traffic.

9
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,200
How many minutes
to get your little butt in the van?

10
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,460
How many of those?

11
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,050
- Feed the monster under your bed?
- Yes.

12
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,550
Call me every day...

13
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,400
and text me pics
so I don't forget what you look like.

14
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,170
I'm only gonna be gone a week.

15
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,310
Zach.

16
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,000
You're not going off to war here.
Please.

17
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,110
Come on.

18
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,180
- I will see you later.
- I love you.

19
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,120
- Bye, okay?
- Bye.

20
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,720
Are you in, buddy?

21
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,660
I know it hurts, sweetheart.

22
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,340
Are you gonna be okay?

23
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,330
Everything right on there?

24
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,250
I'm so jealous.

25
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,460
You're gonna have so much fun.
I love you.

26
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,760
I love you, too.

27
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,380
Okay, great.

28
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,780
All right, let's give these
to your brother, okay?

29
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,350
You hold these, please.
Can you hold these?

30
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
- Honey, I need you to take care of these.
- Yeah.

31
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,510
Hey.

32
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,480
- Alright.
- Listen to your mother.

33
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,370
Take care of your brother.
Answer your phone.

34
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,040
I'm serious. It's the green button.
When you see my name, push it, okay?

35
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,160
And remember...
something chases you, run.

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,720
Come on.

37
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,370
- All right.
- You're funny. Okay, let's go. Come on.

38
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,370
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

39
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,850
- I miss you already.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,070
So much for our last family breakfast.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,650
Why do you have to say things like that?

42
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,540
Did you call your sister?

43
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,020
Straight to voice-mail.

44
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,820
It'll be fine.

45
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,890
She handles 20,000 people a day, right?

46
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,200
She can handle two more.

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,720
How big is the island?

48
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,350
Big.

49
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,290
But how many pounds?

50
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,310
That doesn't make sense.

51
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,010
When they first opened,
they had 8 species.

52
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,830
Now they have 14 herbivores
and 6 carnivores.

53
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,510
That's 50 tons of food a week.

54
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,210
Welcome to Isla Nublar,
home of Jurassic World.

55
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,910
We hope you have
a safe and enjoyable stay with us.

56
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,380
Where's Aunt Claire?

57
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,200
Those of you in the front of the train
should be able to see our main gates.

58
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,790
Please obey all park rules.

59
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,390
Proper attire, including shoes and shirts,
must be worn at all times.

60
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,140
Your aunt arranged to meet you at 1:00.
Can he slow down?

61
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,740
Nope.

62
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,770
Come on!

63
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,080
Your aunt's got you VIP access...

64
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,630
so you can get in all the rides
without waiting in line.

65
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,890
Let's go.

66
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,110
Dude, she said we had to wait.

67
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,680
I don't wanna wait anymore.

68
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,600
Hal Osterley, vice president.
Jim Drucker, bad hair.

69
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,890
Erica Brand, deserves better.

70
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,800
Hal, Jim, Erica.
Hal, Jim, Erica.

71
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,400
And I am Claire.

72
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,710
Three minutes late.

73
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,940
Welcome to Jurassic World.

74
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,820
While year over year,
revenue continues to climb...

75
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,080
operating costs are higher than ever.

76
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,650
Our shareholders have been patient
but let's be honest...

77
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,960
no one is impressed
by a dinosaur anymore.

78
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,050
20 years ago, de-extinction
was right up there with magic.

79
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,530
These days, kids look at a Stegosaurus
like an elephant from the city zoo.

80
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,330
That doesn't mean
asset development is falling behind.

81
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,120
Our DNA excavators
discover new species every year.

82
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,240
But consumers want them bigger,
louder, more teeth.

83
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,840
The good news?

84
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,510
Our advances in gene splicing
have opened up a whole new frontier.

85
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,190
We've learned more from genetics
in the past decade...

86
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,160
than a century of digging up bones.

87
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,120
So...

88
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,090
when you say you want to
sponsor an attraction...

89
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,950
what do you have in mind?

90
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,770
We want to be thrilled.

91
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,550
Don't we all?

92
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,510
The Indominus Rex.
Our first genetically modified hybrid.

93
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,190
How did you get two different kinds
of dinosaurs to, you know...

94
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,990
Oh, Indominus wasn't bred.
She was designed.

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,270
She will be 50 feet long
when fully grown.

96
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,530
Bigger than the T. Rex.

97
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,020
Every time we've unveiled a new asset,
attendance has spiked.

98
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,660
Global news coverage...

99
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,460
celebrity visitors.

100
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,290
Eyes of the world.

101
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,890
When will she be ready?

102
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,710
She already is.

103
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,690
Come on!

104
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,080
Relax.

105
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,580
Come on.

106
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,130
Dude, chill.

107
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,170
Welcome to the Innovation Center,
where technology meets prehistory.

108
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,590
can go horn-to-tooth
with the apex predators.

109
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,180
Literally meaning "three-horned face"
in Greek...

110
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,120
Triceratops is half as tall as T. Rex

111
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,120
as one-hundred trillion tons of TNT.

112
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,590
turn its head back
to look over its shoulder...

113
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,210
to better aim the swing
of its dangerous tail.

114
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,300
Cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine.

115
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,960
The same four things
in everything that ever lived.

116
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,500
Hey, don't wander off, all right?
Mom's not paying me for babysitting.

117
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,020
Gray, is that you?

118
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,480
Aunt Claire!

119
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,950
Okay, yeah. No, I'm gonna have to go.
My nephews are here.

120
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,840
Hi.

121
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,490
Oh, my gosh, you're so sweet.

122
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,740
Whoa, Zach.

123
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,310
Last time I saw you, you were like...

124
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,700
That must've been what?

125
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,300
- Three, four years ago?
- Seven.

126
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,560
Seven years, but, you know, close.

127
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,560
I see you already got your wristbands.

128
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,240
And this is for food.

129
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,080
And Zara here is going
to take great care of you...

130
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,030
until I'm done working tonight, okay?

131
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,020
You're not coming with us?

132
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,130
I really wish that I could, but...

133
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,900
tomorrow I can take you
into the control room...

134
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,980
show you behind the scenes
and all of that.

135
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,210
That's gonna be cool, right?

136
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:40,150
Okay, so I will see you
tonight at... 6:00.

137
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,690
No, no, no.
Don't forget you have the...

138
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,800
Right, of course.
I will see you tonight at 8:00.

139
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,450
What time do you go to sleep?
Or do you go to sleep at different times?

140
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,150
Okay, so, have fun...

141
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,950
and take very good care of them, okay?

142
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,950
Yeah. No, I'm here.

143
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,040
It's those two juvenile Triceratops.
They're going at it again.

144
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,940
Should I tranq them, or are you
coming over to take care of this?

145
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,860
- Go ahead and tranq them.
- They're running.

146
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,910
- What's the live count?
- 22,216.

147
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,340
- Any incidents?
- Yes.

148
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,090
Six kids in the Lost and Found...

149
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,520
28 down with heatstroke...

150
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,170
Where did you get that?

151
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,770
Oh, this? I got it on eBay.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

152
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,860
I got it for $150
but the mint condition one goes for $300...

153
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,520
Didn't occur to you
maybe that's in poor taste?

154
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,380
The shirt? Yeah, no, it did.

155
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,300
I understand people died.
It was terrible...

156
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,740
but that first park was legit.

157
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,600
I have a lot of respect for it.
They didn't need these genetic hybrids.

158
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,660
They just needed dinosaurs,
real dinosaurs.

159
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,520
Okay, please don't wear it again.

160
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,680
Yeah, I wasn't gonna.

161
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,040
- Did you close the deal?
- Looks like it.

162
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,770
Verizon Wireless presents
the Indominus Rex.

163
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,680
That is so terrible.

164
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,850
Why not just go the distance, and just let
these corporations name the dinosaurs?

165
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,330
They've got all the ballparks.

166
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,930
- Why stop there?
- Why are the West Plains closed?

167
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,690
Another Pachy roaming outside his zone.

168
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,550
But he's fully sedated
and ready for relocation.

169
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,920
Pepsi-saurus or Tostito-don.

170
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,850
Security said the
invisible fences were a

171
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,910
no-fail. That is the
second time this month.

172
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,010
The Pachys short out their implants
when they butt heads.

173
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,020
How much longer
until they get it out of there?

174
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,770
He just got five milligrams
of carfentanil.

175
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,050
Yes, he's very stoned.
So why don't we show a little sympathy?

176
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,410
I mean you do understand
these are actual animals, right?

177
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,230
Clean up your workspace.

178
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,760
It's chaotic.

179
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,260
I like to think of it
as a living system.

180
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,900
Just enough stability...

181
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,890
to keep it from collapsing into anarchy.

182
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,980
Inbound chopper, Jurassic 1.
ETA, 5 minutes.

183
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,130
Claire.

184
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,550
Mr. Masrani. You are flying.

185
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,160
I got my license.

186
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,540
- Two more.
- Well, two more days.

187
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,710
- Okay.
- So...

188
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,880
- how's my park doing?
- Great.

189
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,210
We're up two and a half percent
over last year.

190
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,070
A bit lower than our initial prediction.

191
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,840
No, no, no, how's it doing?

192
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,790
Are the guests having fun?
Are the animals enjoying life?

193
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,990
Well, guest satisfaction is steady
in the low 90s.

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,200
We don't have a way to measure
the animals' emotional experience.

195
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,650
Sure you do. You can see in their eyes.

196
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,030
Right?

197
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,330
Of course.

198
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,830
Okay. Now show me my new dinosaur.

199
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,410
Got it.

200
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,090
Got it.

201
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,980
Got it.

202
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,500
Oh, my!

203
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,070
You look tense, Claire.

204
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,110
Maybe you should just focus
on the controls.

205
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,980
The key to a happy life is to accept
you are never actually in control.

206
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,560
Bird!

207
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,360
You should spend a day at the beach.

208
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,710
Get some sun.

209
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,780
Right, so...

210
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,680
Marketing thought we could
offset some of the costs by...

211
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,460
Enough about cost.

212
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,290
John Hammond entrusted me
with his dying wish...

213
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,190
and not once did he mention profits.

214
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,530
"Spare no expense," he used to say.

215
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,930
I appreciate that, but the reality
of operating a theme park requires...

216
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,780
Don't forget
why we built this place, Claire.

217
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,720
Jurassic World exists to remind us
how very small we are. How new.

218
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,350
You can't put a price on that.

219
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,080
Now, please, we're flying.

220
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,120
Breathe.

221
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,400
Is he okay?

222
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,590
- Are you okay?
- He's just being dramatic.

223
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,140
Are you still building?

224
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,230
We planned to open in May...

225
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,680
but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher.

226
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,550
It's bigger than expected.

227
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,260
It's a good sign.

228
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,260
We hit a few speed bumps early on.

229
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,530
It began to anticipate where
the food would come from.

230
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,660
One of the handlers nearly lost an arm.

231
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,220
The others threatened to quit
if I couldn't guarantee their safety.

232
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,850
She's intelligent then?

233
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,930
For a dinosaur.

234
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,920
And that?

235
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,130
It tried to break the glass.

236
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,620
I like her spirit.

237
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,840
It's white.
You never told me it was white.

238
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,160
Think it will scare the kids?

239
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,390
The kids?

240
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,360
This will give the parents nightmares.

241
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,550
Is that good?

242
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,160
It's fantastic.

243
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,500
Can she see us?

244
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,140
They say it can sense thermal radiation.
Like snakes.

245
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,950
I thought there were two of them.

246
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,730
There was a sibling
in case this one didn't survive infancy.

247
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,050
Where's the sibling?

248
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,690
She ate it.

249
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,450
So, the paddock is quite safe, then?

250
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,790
We have the best structural engineers
in the world.

251
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,200
Yeah, so did Hammond.

252
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,780
There's an American Navy man here.

253
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,640
Part of a research program
one of my companies is running.

254
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,010
Owen Grady.

255
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,650
I know who he is.

256
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,600
His animals often try to escape.

257
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,890
They are smart.
He has to be smarter.

258
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,460
He only thinks he's smarter.

259
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,350
I want you to bring him in.

260
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,250
Let him inspect the paddock.

261
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,150
Maybe he sees something we can't.

262
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,670
Hold!

263
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,060
Hey!

264
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,380
Okay!

265
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,080
Eyes on me.

266
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,470
Blue?

267
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,000
Blue!

268
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,260
Watch it.

269
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,020
Charlie. Hey!

270
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,580
Don't give me that shit!

271
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,390
Delta!

272
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,780
Lock it up!

273
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,370
Good!

274
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,470
And we're moving!

275
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,190
Hold!

276
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,730
That's good. That is damn good.

277
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,940
Very good!

278
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,580
See, Charlie, that's what you get!

279
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,510
Echo, there you go!

280
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Delta!

281
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,120
Blue?

282
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,860
This one's for you.

283
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,250
Hold!

284
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,960
Eyes up!

285
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,010
Go.

286
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,960
You finally did it, man.

287
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,980
Owen.

288
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,980
I was starting to think I hired
the wrong guys...

289
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,940
but, damn, you got them
eating out of your palm.

290
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,150
You came on a good day.
It's not usually a happy ending.

291
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,070
Is that why
you're not sending in your reports?

292
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,270
We've been busy.

293
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,800
Not too busy to cash your paychecks.

294
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,020
What do you need, buddy?

295
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,020
A field test.

296
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,800
Hey. I've just seen
they can respond to commands.

297
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,280
We need to take the research
and get it on its feet.

298
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,050
These are wild animals, Hoskins.
Trust me, you don't want them in the field.

299
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,290
I just saw a bond. A real bond.

300
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,190
Between man and beast.

301
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,160
- You're in my way.
- Come on. We're the same.

302
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,630
We're dogs of war.

303
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,830
We know that the military
needs to reduce casualties.

304
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,090
Some people think
that robots are the future.

305
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,440
Look, nature gave us the most effective
killing machines 75 million years ago.

306
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,710
And now we know they can take orders.

307
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,570
We finally make progress
and that's the first thing he says?

308
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,950
Make a weapon?

309
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,320
Shit.

310
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,230
Come on, gents.

311
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,970
It's grown-up time.

312
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,230
Drones can't search tunnels and caves.
And they're hackable.

313
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,640
The minute a real war breaks out,
all that fancy tech is gonna go dark.

314
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,790
But that tech's not gonna eat them
if they forget to feed it.

315
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,670
Look at these creatures.

316
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,910
They've got millions of
years of instinct in

317
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,060
their cells, instinct
that we can program.

318
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,970
Their loyalty cannot be bought.

319
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,570
These guys are gonna run straight
into the enemy's teeth and eat them...

320
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,860
belt buckle and all.

321
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,930
What if they decide
they wanna be in control?

322
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,860
Then we remind them who is.
We terminate the rogues.

323
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,220
Promote only loyal bloodlines.

324
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,640
What? What's so funny?

325
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,720
You come here and you
don't learn anything about these animal,

326
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,570
except what you want to know.

327
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,950
You made them
and now you think you own them.

328
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,080
We do own them.

329
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,120
Extinct animals have no rights.

330
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,270
They're not extinct anymore, Hoskins.

331
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,380
Exactly. We're sitting on a goldmine.

332
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,410
And Masrani is using it
to stock a petting zoo.

333
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,120
He just wants to teach people some
humility. He doesn't make weapons.

334
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,900
You think that the 8th richest man
in the world...

335
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,960
is only into oil, telecom
and family fun parks?

336
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,420
He's so diversified,
he doesn't even know what he owns.

337
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,660
How long has INGEN
been practicing this pitch?

338
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,820
Since the day we hired you out of the Navy.
You knew the end game.

339
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,670
These animals can replace
thousands of boots on the ground.

340
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,260
How many lives would that save?

341
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,640
War is part of nature.

342
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,360
Look around, Owen.
Every living thing in this jungle...

343
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,980
is trying to murder the other.

344
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,180
Mother Nature's way of testing
her creations.

345
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,020
Refining the pecking order.

346
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,920
War is a struggle.
Struggle breeds greatness.

347
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,040
Without that...

348
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,920
we end up with places like this,
charge seven bucks a soda.

349
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,410
Do you hear yourself when you talk?

350
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,610
This is gonna happen.
With or without you boys.

351
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,450
Progress always wins, man.

352
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,170
Maybe progress should lose for once.

353
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,350
Pig loose!

354
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,590
Pig loose!

355
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,130
Owen, no!

356
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,190
No, hold your fire!

357
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,330
Hold your fire. Do not fire.

358
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,770
Put 12 amps in these animals,
they're never gonna trust me again.

359
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,310
Blue, stand down.

360
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,470
Stand down.

361
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,660
Hey! Hey! What did I just say?

362
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,650
Delta, I see you. Back up!

363
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,560
Okay.

364
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,230
Good.

365
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,030
Good.

366
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,780
Charlie?

367
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,770
Stay right there.

368
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Good.

369
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,610
Close the gate.

370
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,380
Are you crazy?

371
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,980
Just trust me.

372
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,390
Close the gate!

373
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
Yeah.

374
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,090
You're the new guy, right?

375
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,560
Yeah.

376
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,290
You ever wonder why there was
a job opening?

377
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,140
Don't ever turn your back to the cage.

378
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,420
Lift me up. I can't see!

379
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,110
I'm not Dad. And you're not five.

380
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,040
I can still ride the Triceratops.
I'm 47-and-a-half inches.

381
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,570
This place is for little kids.

382
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,960
Yeah, I know.

383
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,960
- Wanna go on the spinning dinosaur eggs?
- Nope.

384
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,990
Cover up your dork pouch.

385
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,030
It's my wedding.

386
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,380
No, Alec's not having a bachelor party.

387
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,350
Because all his friends are animals.

388
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,530
Scatter.

389
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,590
- What?
- Go. Run. Go! Go, go!

390
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,100
The next T. Rex feeding
will begin in 10 minutes.

391
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,410
- T. Rex! Come on, man!
- Okay.

392
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,300
Let's go!

393
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,870
Parents be aware, this show may be
disturbing for smaller children.

394
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,120
Hey, Mom.

395
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,940
You were supposed to call me
when you landed.

396
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,310
Are you having fun?

397
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,230
Yeah, I guess.

398
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,480
Aunt Claire gave us passes
so we don't have to wait in line.

399
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,100
Wait, she's not with you?

400
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,370
Hey, Karen!

401
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,150
Hi, Claire. How's it going?

402
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,060
Yeah, everything's great.
The boys are having fun.

403
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,630
Everyone's... Yeah, everyone's good.

404
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,630
Really? Because I just
hung up with Zach and

405
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,450
he said that you weren't
even with them.

406
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,250
Yeah, look. Today turned out to be
a really bad day for me.

407
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,630
They're in great hands.
They're with my assistant.

408
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,380
She's British, so, like,
they invented nannies.

409
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,480
Wait, are you crying?

410
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,610
This was supposed to be
a family weekend, Claire.

411
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,540
You haven't seen the boys in forever.

412
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,830
And I know how Zach will treat Gray
if they're by themselves.

413
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,430
And he can just be so mean.

414
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,280
Okay, I'm sorry.

415
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:09,710
Tomorrow, I'm gonna spend
the entire day with them.

416
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,920
I'm going to take off work
and I will not leave their side. I promise.

417
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,600
Well, a promise tomorrow is worth
a lot less than trying today.

418
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,390
You're using Mom's lines now?

419
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,560
Oh, my God.
I am using Mom's lines.

420
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,510
I'm sorry, but you know
I have to tell you they work.

421
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,120
You'll see when you have kids.

422
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,410
Yeah, "if."

423
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,090
"When." It's worth it.

424
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,830
Bye, Mom.

425
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,850
Bye.

426
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,370
What do they want now?

427
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,830
Mr. Grady?

428
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,670
I need you to come
take a look at something.

429
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,200
Why are you calling me Mr. Grady?

430
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,620
Owen.

431
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,840
- If you're not too busy.
- I'm pretty busy.

432
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,570
We have an attraction.

433
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,410
That's not what you said
the last time I saw you.

434
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,060
I'm talking about the dinosaurs,
Mr. Grady.

435
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,950
Owen.

436
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,860
A new species we've... made.

437
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,290
You just went and made a new dinosaur?

438
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,020
Yeah, it's kind of what we do here.

439
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,190
The exhibit opens to the public
in three weeks.

440
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,350
Mr. Masrani wanted me
to consult with you.

441
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,420
You wanna consult here or...
in my bungalow?

442
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,340
That's not funny.

443
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,780
A little funny.

444
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,800
We'd like you to evaluate the paddock
for vulnerabilities.

445
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,900
Why me?

446
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,340
I guess Mr. Masrani thinks,
since you're able to control the Raptors...

447
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,970
It's all about control with you.

448
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,730
I don't control the Raptors.
It's a relationship.

449
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,400
It's based on mutual respect.

450
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,600
That's why you and I never had
a second date.

451
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,450
Excuse me?
I never wanted a second date.

452
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,170
Who prints out an itinerary
for a night out?

453
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,830
I'm an organized person.

454
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,020
What kind of a diet
doesn't allow tequila?

455
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,650
All of them, actually.

456
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,980
And what kind of a man
shows up to a date in board shorts?

457
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,710
It's Central America. It's hot.

458
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,380
Okay, okay.
Can we just focus on the asset, please?

459
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,660
The asset?

460
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,750
Look, I get it.
You're in charge out here.

461
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,210
You gotta make a lot of tough decisions.

462
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,910
It's probably easier to pretend these
animals are just numbers on a spreadsheet.

463
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,100
But they're not. They're alive.

464
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,700
I'm fully aware they're alive.

465
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,610
You might have made them in a test tube,
but they don't know that.

466
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,550
They're thinking, "I gotta eat."

467
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,730
"I gotta hunt. I gotta..."

468
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,980
You can relate to at least
one of those things. Right?

469
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,910
I'll be in the car.

470
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:13,890
You might want to change your shirt.
They're very sensitive to smell.

471
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,010
The Mosasaurus was thought to have
hunted near the surface of the water...

472
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,470
where it preyed on anything
it could sink its teeth into.

473
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,910
Including turtles, large fish,
even smaller Mosasaurus.

474
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:41,020
Okay, folks, let's see if she's still
hungry after already eating today.

475
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:46,400
She's a little shy, so be nice
and give her a hand when she comes out.

476
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,400
Zach!

477
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,730
The Mosasaurus!

478
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,320
Oh, my God! That was awesome!

479
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,650
Hold on tight. We're gonna give you
an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.

480
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,390
It had 88 teeth!

481
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,840
- Wanna see something else cool?
- Yeah!

482
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,060
We've been pre-booking tickets
for months.

483
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,170
The park needs a new attraction
every few years...

484
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,370
in order to reinvigorate
the public's interest.

485
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,020
Kind of like the space program.

486
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,000
Corporate felt genetic modification
would up the wow factor.

487
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,050
They're dinosaurs. Wow enough.

488
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:00,340
Not according to our focus groups.
The Indominus Rex makes us relevant again.

489
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,130
The Indominus Rex?

490
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,130
We needed something scary
and easy to pronounce.

491
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,260
You should hear a four-year-old try to say
"Archaeornithomimus."

492
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,010
You should hear you try to say it.

493
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,010
So what's this thing made of?

494
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:23,840
The base genome is a T. Rex.
The rest is classified.

495
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,520
You made a new dinosaur
but you don't even know what it is?

496
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:30,210
The lab delivers us finished assets,
and we show them to the public.

497
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,130
Can we drop a steer, please?

498
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,160
How long has the animal been in here?

499
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,390
All its life.

500
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,760
Never seen anything outside
of these walls?

501
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,120
We can't exactly walk it.

502
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,620
And you feed it with that?

503
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,580
Is there a problem?

504
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,000
Animals raised in isolation aren't
always the most functional.

505
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,330
Your Raptors are born in captivity.

506
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,100
With siblings. They learn social skills.

507
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,230
And I imprint on them when they're born.

508
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,500
There's trust.

509
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,330
The only positive relationship
this animal has is with that crane.

510
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,380
At least she knows that means food.

511
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,140
So, she needs a friend.

512
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,770
We should schedule play-dates?
That sort of thing?

513
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,760
Probably not a good idea.

514
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,370
- Where is it?
- Is it in the basement?

515
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,930
Is there a downstairs?
Maybe it's in the rec room.

516
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,910
It was just here. We were just here.

517
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,900
Oh, shit.

518
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,660
That doesn't make any sense.

519
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,240
These doors haven't been opened
in weeks.

520
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,970
Were those claw marks always there?

521
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,320
Do you think it...?

522
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,640
Oh, God.

523
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,810
She has an implant in her back.

524
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,300
I can track it from the control room.

525
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,260
We have an asset out of containment.

526
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,160
Put ACU on alert. This is not a drill.

527
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,090
Even though I didn't meet him
until I was 13...

528
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,330
I definitely consider Carl to be
more of a dad than my real dad.

529
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,960
- Yeah, hello?
- Lowery.

530
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,250
Get me coordinates on the Indominus.

531
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,170
Okay, yeah.

532
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,050
I'm doing it right now.

533
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,710
That wall is 40 feet high.

534
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,060
Do you really think
she could have climbed out?

535
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,270
It depends.

536
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,060
On what?

537
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:20,070
What kind of dinosaur
they cooked up in that lab.

538
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,830
Wait, what the hell?

539
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,430
It's in the cage.

540
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,780
No, that's impossible.
I was just there.

541
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,510
Claire, I'm telling you, she's in the cage.

542
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,490
Wait a sec.

543
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,230
There are people in there.

544
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,270
Get them out of there now.

545
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,850
Now!

546
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,770
Paddock 11, this is Control.
You need to evacuate the containment area.

547
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,180
Paddock 11.

548
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,500
Paddock 11, do you copy?

549
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,430
Yeah, what's the problem?

550
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,640
It's in the cage!
It's in there with you!

551
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,990
Go!

552
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,250
Close the door.

553
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,860
We can't lock him in
there with that thing.

554
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,420
Close it now!

555
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,290
Somebody talk to me!
What is happening?

556
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,800
Shit!

557
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,800
Everyone remain calm.

558
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,520
The implant will shock it
if it gets too close to a perimeter fence.

559
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,070
Okay. It's moving really fast.

560
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,110
This is Control. Put
out a park-wide alert.

561
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,670
Hang up that damn phone, please.

562
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,660
Sorry, I'm getting new information.
Everything's fine.

563
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,430
Let Asset Containment
capture it quietly.

564
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,300
The very existence of this park
is predicated on our ability...

565
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,230
to handle incidents like this.

566
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,210
It was an eventuality, okay?

567
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,890
You should put that in the brochure.

568
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,660
"Eventually, one of these things
will eat somebody."

569
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,950
That paddock is 4 miles
from the closest attraction.

570
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,610
ACU can handle this.
No one else is gonna get...

571
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,790
Eaten?

572
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,690
How fast can they run?

573
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,920
40.

574
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,650
50 when they're hungry.

575
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,680
You ever open them up,
see what they can do?

576
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,520
No.

577
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,440
Oh, shit!

578
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,050
That got me. It got me.

579
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,070
What do you think?
Want to take one home?

580
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,150
Hey, don't joke.

581
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,210
When I was your age...

582
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,910
I rescued a wolf pup.

583
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,940
It was, like, two months old.
It could barely walk.

584
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,620
It used to sleep by my bed.

585
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,730
Watch over me.

586
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:22,860
My wife, she came at me with a steak knife.
It took a chunk out of her arm.

587
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,540
Did you put him down?

588
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,610
Hell, no.

589
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,080
We had an unshakeable bond, you know?

590
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,750
Just like you and...

591
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,590
What's his name?

592
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,110
Delta. And she's a girl.

593
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,410
Can I...?

594
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,140
Oh, wow.

595
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,010
Code 19!

596
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,710
- That's the new one!
- They said we lost two guys!

597
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,210
- What's a Code 19?
- That's Indominus!

598
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,220
Asset out of containment.

599
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,950
These people, they never learn.

600
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,010
They're gonna learn all kinds of things
about their new asset now.

601
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:25,420
Yeah, it's me.
We might have an opportunity here.

602
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,600
You guys been here before?

603
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,720
If Mom and Dad get divorced, will one of us
be with Mom and the other with Dad?

604
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,270
What? Why would you say that?

605
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,270
Because they are.

606
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,340
No, they're not getting...
They're not getting divorced.

607
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,290
Look, you haven't been around long enough.
They've always been that way.

608
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,730
They get mail
from two different lawyers.

609
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,160
That doesn't mean anything.

610
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,910
I googled. They're divorce lawyers.

611
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,030
All right, whatever.

612
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,090
You know what? It doesn't matter. Okay?
I'm gonna be gone in two years anyway.

613
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,410
All my friends' parents are divorced.

614
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,090
Hey, knock it off.

615
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,580
You're gonna cry?

616
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,030
Look, you're gonna get two of everything.

617
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,850
Right? Two birthdays,
two Thanksgivings. Two...

618
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,540
I don't want two of everything.

619
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,600
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.

620
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,990
There's a point you have to grow up.

621
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,950
I need to see a badge.

622
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,210
- Sir, sir. I need to see a badge.
- What the hell happened out there?

623
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:15,720
Sir!

624
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,790
There are thermal cameras
all over that paddock.

625
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,400
She did not just disappear!

626
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,660
It must have been some kind
of a technical malfunction.

627
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,950
Were you not watching?

628
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,680
She marked up that wall as a distraction.
She wanted us to think she escaped!

629
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,030
Hold on.
We are talking about an animal here.

630
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,540
- A highly intelligent animal.
- 400 meters to the beacon.

631
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,300
You're going after her with non-lethals.

632
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,440
We have $26 million invested in that asset.
We can't just kill it.

633
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,840
Those men are gonna die.

634
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,240
300 meters to the beacon.

635
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,610
- Call this mission off right now.
- They're right on top of it.

636
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,990
- Call it off right now.
- You are not in control here!

637
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,620
Blood's not clotted yet.

638
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,850
It's close.

639
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,480
What is that?

640
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,550
That's her tracking implant.
She clawed it out.

641
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,460
How would it know to do that?

642
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:00,190
She remembered where they put it in.

643
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,310
It can camouflage!

644
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,010
Evacuate the island.

645
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,020
We'd never reopen.

646
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:40,670
You made a genetic hybrid,
raised it in captivity.

647
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,320
She is seeing all of this
for the first time.

648
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,030
She does not even know what she is.

649
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,850
She will kill everything that moves.

650
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,110
Do you think the animal
is contemplating its own existence?

651
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,090
She is learning where she fits
in the food chain...

652
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,110
and I'm not sure you want
her to figure that out.

653
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,060
Now, Asset Containment can use live
ammunition in an emergency situation.

654
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:04,260
You have an M134 in your armory.
Put it on a chopper and smoke this thing!

655
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,350
We have families here. I'm not gonna turn
this place into some kind of a war zone.

656
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,590
You already have.

657
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,200
Mr. Grady, if you're not gonna help,
there's no reason for you to be in here.

658
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,060
I would have a word
with your people in the lab.

659
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:26,720
That thing out there...
that's no dinosaur.

660
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,700
I'm going to close everything
north of the resort.

661
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:52,450
This is a Phase One, real world.
Bring everyone in.

662
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,490
This is a Phase One, real world.
I repeat, this is a Phase One.

663
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,230
Bring everyone back in.

664
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,600
The soft tissue is preserved
because the iron in the dinosaur's blood...

665
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,990
generates free radicals,
and those are highly reactive.

666
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,940
The proteins and the cell membranes
get all mixed up...

667
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,150
and act as a natural preservative.

668
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,710
DNA can survive for millennia that way.

669
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,520
Even if the amber mines dry up,
they'll still have bones...

670
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,530
Shut up.

671
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,510
What do you think's gonna happen
from you just staring at them?

672
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,370
- Thanks, man.
- You're welcome.

673
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,200
Enjoy the ride.

674
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,560
Pregnant women and those who
suffer from motion sickness...

675
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,010
should consult with a doctor
before riding this ride.

676
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,670
Enjoy the ride.

677
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,550
Hello?

678
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,280
Seriously?

679
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,500
Sorry, folks. The ride is closed.

680
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,260
Everyone needs to proceed to the monorail
and exit towards the...

681
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,790
Come on, guys, I just work here.

682
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,420
Due to technical difficulties,
all our exhibits are now closed.

683
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:34,650
You know that I'm not at liberty
to reveal the asset's genetic makeup.

684
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,740
Modified animals are known
to be unpredictable.

685
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,520
It's killed people, Henry.

686
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,310
That's unfortunate.

687
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,460
What purpose could we have
for a dinosaur that can camouflage?

688
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:52,260
Cuttlefish genes were added to help her
withstand an accelerated growth rate.

689
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:56,680
Cuttlefish have chromatophores
that allow the skin to change color.

690
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,650
It hid from thermal technology.

691
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,670
Really?

692
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,270
How is that possible?

693
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:10,210
Tree frogs can modulate
their infrared output.

694
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,350
We used strands from their DNA
to adapt her to a tropical climate.

695
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,340
But I never imagined...

696
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,130
Who authorized you to do this?

697
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,310
You did.

698
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,820
"Bigger."

699
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,470
"Scarier."

700
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:29,000
"Cooler" I believe is the word
that you used in your memo.

701
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:32,710
You cannot have an animal
with exaggerated predator features...

702
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,490
without the corresponding
behavioral traits.

703
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,930
What you're doing here...

704
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,890
What you have done...

705
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,770
The Board will shut down this park,
seize your work, everything you've built.

706
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:48,270
And Hammond won't be there
to protect you this time.

707
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,310
All of this exists because of me.

708
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:56,230
If I don't innovate, somebody else will.

709
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:00,640
You are to cease
all activities here immediately.

710
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,420
You are acting like we are engaged
in some kind of mad science.

711
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:09,270
But we are doing
what we have done from the beginning.

712
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,630
Nothing in Jurassic World is natural.

713
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,600
We have always filled gaps in the genome
with the DNA of other animals.

714
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:20,860
And, if their genetic code was pure,
many of them would look quite different.

715
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,450
But you didn't ask for reality.
You asked for more teeth.

716
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,320
- I never asked for a monster!
- "Monster" is a relative term.

717
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:29,050
To a canary, a cat is a monster.

718
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,660
We're just used to being the cat.

719
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,650
Hey, there. I'm Jimmy Fallon.

720
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,700
Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere, an amazing
machine made possible by science.

721
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,370
Your safety is our main concern.

722
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,610
Which is why you're behind
our invisible barrier system...

723
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,650
which protects you from things
like Dilophosaurus venom.

724
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:54,260
One drop of this can paralyze you,
so watch out.

725
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,260
Is this real? It is?

726
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:02,210
And for added protection, each vehicle
is surrounded by aluminum oxynitride glass.

727
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,280
So tough,
it can stop a .50-caliber bullet.

728
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,590
The Gyroscopic technology will keep you
upright at all times...

729
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,780
Where are they?

730
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,210
So you've got nothing to worry about.

731
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,300
Oh, man.

732
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:55,160
Due to technical difficulties
all our exhibits are now closed.

733
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:58,580
Please disembark all rides
and return to the resort.

734
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,680
Come on, we can stay out
a couple more minutes.

735
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,700
But they said it was closed.

736
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,990
Aunt Claire gave us
special wristbands, right?

737
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,380
We're VIP, dude.

738
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,250
Come on. It'll be fun.

739
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,530
- Hello?
- Zara.

740
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,850
I need you to bring the boys
back to the hotel right away.

741
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,980
I don't know...
I've been looking everywhere for them.

742
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,130
Slow down. I can't hear you.

743
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,470
Zach and Gray, they've run off.

744
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
They what?

745
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,900
Hey, Claire.

746
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,360
Zach, thank God.
Is Gray with you?

747
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:09,010
I can't really hear you.
We're in the hamster ball.

748
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,920
Okay. Zach, listen to me.

749
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,210
I need you to...

750
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,990
Hello?

751
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,990
- Hello?
- Zach?

752
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,990
Are there any Gyrospheres
left in the Valley?

753
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,730
No, they're all accounted for.
It's my job.

754
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,330
What?

755
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,040
There's one in the field.

756
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,950
Send a team of rangers, bring them in.

757
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,930
Security, we need a search and rescue
in the Valley.

758
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,340
It's gonna be a while.
We've got our hands full out here.

759
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,190
No, no, no. There are two guests missing!

760
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,100
You need to make this your top priority!

761
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,500
- Just do it, man.
- There's a lot of guests missing.

762
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:41,500
We're doing the best we can.

763
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,420
Okay. Fine. I'll do it myself.

764
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:47,050
Hey, do you think I'm the one you need
to be worried about right now?

765
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,060
Back off!

766
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,030
What happened here?

767
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,440
Dude.

768
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,220
Off-road.

769
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,440
But they told us to go back.

770
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:11,140
I'm just worried you're not getting
the full Jurassic World experience.

771
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,340
Claire!

772
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,640
- I need you.
- Okay.

773
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,630
I need your help.

774
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,760
My nephews, they're out in the Valley.
Please, if anything happens to them...

775
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,690
How old?

776
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:43,980
The older one, he's high school age.
The younger one, he's...

777
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:48,440
- He's a few years...
- You don't know how old your nephews are?

778
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,590
No, no. Bad idea, bad idea.

779
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,700
- Great idea.
- No! We're gonna get arrested.

780
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,810
They'll shave our heads, and we're
gonna have to make root beer in the toilet.

781
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,990
What are you talking about?

782
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,610
There.

783
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,830
You see? I told you.

784
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,090
You're welcome.
Up close and personal...

785
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,800
with four dinosauruses.

786
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,500
Ankylosaurus.

787
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,170
We shouldn't be here.
And there's five dinosaurs.

788
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:20,650
Aren't you supposed to be
a genius or something? Look.

789
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,130
One, two, three...

790
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,180
four.

791
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,860
Five.

792
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,870
- Go, go, go!
- Shit!

793
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,520
Hold it together, man!

794
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,890
Drive! Drive! Go!

795
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,850
We're safe in here, right?

796
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,450
Yeah. They're totally safe.

797
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,610
Come on.

798
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,720
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

799
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,310
Zach.

800
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,320
I almost got it.

801
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,690
- Zach?
- Yeah?

802
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,690
Look.

803
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,700
What?

804
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,570
Go! Go!

805
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,030
- We're gonna have to jump.
- I can't.

806
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,750
Are you ready? One, two...
Come on!

807
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,970
You jumped.

808
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:32,380
Stay in the car.

809
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:04,530
Hi.

810
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,200
Hi.

811
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,840
I know, I know.

812
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,880
It's all right.

813
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:36,520
All right, girl.

814
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:53,290
Okay.

815
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,530
Okay, okay, okay.

816
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,970
You're okay. Okay.

817
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,330
It didn't eat them.

818
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:56,140
It's killing for sport.

819
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,060
Units on standby, ready for go.

820
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:08,980
Good. Hold off on that live feed.
We've got an evolving situation here.

821
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:10,510
Did they give you the green light yet?

822
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,370
They will.

823
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:21,480
Owen, we have a situation here.

824
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,050
Hey, there. I'm Jimmy Fallon.

825
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,860
Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere, an amazing
machine made possible by science.

826
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:39,400
Hey, there. Your safety is our main
concern. Now just relax and enjoy the ride.

827
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,750
No, no, no. No.

828
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,840
Hey.

829
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:08,900
They made it out.

830
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,550
Oh, my God, they jumped.

831
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,110
Brave kids.

832
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,190
Zach! Gray!

833
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,860
Hey, I am not one of your damn animals.

834
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:33,550
Listen, those kids are still alive...

835
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:38,200
but you and I will not be
if you continue to scream like that.

836
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:44,630
So, you can pick up their scent, can't you?
Track their footprints?

837
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,440
I was with the Navy, not the Navajo.

838
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:48,530
So then what should we do?
What do you suggest we do?

839
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,310
You get back. I'll find them.

840
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,910
No, we'll find them.

841
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,630
You'll last two minutes in there.
Less, in those ridiculous shoes.

842
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:12,140
What is that supposed to mean?

843
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,620
It means I'm ready to go.

844
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,770
Okay.

845
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,800
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm in charge out here.

846
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,690
You do everything I say,
exactly as I say it.

847
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,360
- Excuse me?
- Just relax.

848
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,220
It's just like taking
a stroll through the woods.

849
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,580
65 million years ago.

850
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,920
Stay here.

851
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,730
Wow.

852
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,070
You still have those matches?

853
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,500
Here you go.

854
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:08,300
Gray!

855
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,400
1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, Sand Beige.

856
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:48,170
You remember when we fixed up
Grandpa's old Malibu, right?

857
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,220
Yeah.

858
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,590
Every time this thing kills,
it moves further south.

859
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,540
It's headed right for the park.

860
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:04,110
Why would she come here?

861
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,990
She can sense thermal radiation.

862
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,220
Our emergency measures just put
all the warm bodies in one place.

863
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,860
- Sir...
- INGEN.

864
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:15,570
Hoskins.

865
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:17,900
I know who you are.

866
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,950
Then you know why I'm here.

867
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,610
I've been working for two years
on an application for those Raptors.

868
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,850
They can hunt and kill that creature.

869
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,290
But your program
was to test their intelligence.

870
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,860
Yeah, it was. And we did.

871
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:36,540
And in the process,
we learned something.

872
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,330
They follow orders.

873
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:43,300
You see, the solution to your crisis
is standing right in front of you.

874
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,380
Let me be as clear as I can.

875
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:51,380
No Velociraptors are going to be
set loose on this island.

876
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,530
Oh, shit.

877
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,240
You're out of your mind!

878
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,660
What are you going to do
with all these people?

879
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:57,560
You got 20,000 people here.
What are you going to do?

880
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:59,310
They have no place to go.

881
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,890
That thing is a killing machine!

882
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,060
And it will not stop.

883
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:09,270
Okay.

884
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,550
I intend to personally
look into your project...

885
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:16,380
to determine its viability within the
moral principles of this company.

886
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:20,720
Okay, boss.

887
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:24,220
What's your next move?

888
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,320
Sir, I can't get a hold
of your instructor.

889
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:38,810
Never mind.
He's likely caught up in the evacuation.

890
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:41,330
You're sure there's nobody else
who can fly a helicopter?

891
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:44,950
We don't need anyone else.

892
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,460
You think it's out there?

893
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:19,170
I mean, I know for a fact
it is definitely not out there, all right?

894
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:21,050
We're totally safe.

895
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,950
Here, go take this.

896
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:26,830
You're stronger than me.

897
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:40,560
All right. Turn it over.

898
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:45,340
It works!

899
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,310
I thought you failed your driver's test.

900
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,780
No, only the driving part.

901
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:15,190
This one of theirs?

902
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,200
Yeah.

903
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,970
That road goes
straight back to the park.

904
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:25,060
How did they even get
one of these things started?

905
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,840
Lowery, we found her.

906
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:14,180
South of the Gyrosphere Valley,
between the old park and the Aviary.

907
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:17,130
- Wait, are you following the dinosaur?
- Yes.

908
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:19,710
Get ACU out here.
Real guns this time.

909
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,750
ACU is airborne.
They took the helicopter.

910
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,300
Who's flying it?

911
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,730
Did you boys serve in the Armed Forces?

912
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,600
Afghanistan, sir.

913
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,590
Did your general ever fly
into battle with you?

914
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:41,240
Got it! Got it.

915
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:45,450
We have eyes on the target,
south of the Aviary.

916
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,830
Proceed and engage.

917
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,640
Come on! Look alive, boys!

918
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,180
Look alive!

919
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,500
10 o'clock! By the birdcage!

920
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,500
No, no, no! No, no, no.

921
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:27,010
Looks like the fox got in the henhouse.

922
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,620
Pull up! Pull up! Up, up, up!

923
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,890
We have a breach in the Aviary.

924
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,800
Trees, the trees! Go! Go!

925
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:11,680
Okay, that's it.

926
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:13,820
We're safe now.

927
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,420
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

928
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,610
Hurry up!

929
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,830
Hey!

930
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,860
- Help!
- Open the gate! Let us in!

931
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:38,290
- Open it up!
- Come on!

932
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,250
That's a first.

933
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:41,880
Open the gate!

934
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:43,970
- Open the gate!
- Let us in!

935
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,560
Attention Aviary employees,
there has been a containment breach.

936
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,840
Hello?

937
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,680
Claire, we spotted the
boys on surveillance.

938
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:01,110
They're approaching
the west gate.

939
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,220
I'm headed there now.

940
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:07,350
Okay, okay. Stay right there.
I'm on my way. Stay right with them.

941
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,460
Hey!

942
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:10,090
Get on!

943
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,180
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly...

944
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:29,780
all guests must take shelter immediately.

945
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,130
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly...

946
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:37,060
all guests must take shelter immediately.

947
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,790
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly...

948
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,180
all guests must take shelter immediately.

949
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,300
All units, take position on boardwalk.

950
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:44,660
Use liquid tranquilizers.
Do not fire live ammunition.

951
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:45,670
Claire, come on!

952
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,390
Stop running!

953
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,260
Don't just stand there!

954
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:05,500
Go! Get inside now!

955
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,780
Zach!

956
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:25,530
Gray!

957
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,410
- Aunt Claire!
- Go, go!

958
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:32,420
Claire!

959
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,690
No! Hold your...

960
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,850
Is that Aunt Claire?

961
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:26,120
It's them! Zach!

962
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:27,710
Gray!

963
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:30,940
Oh, my God! Thank God!
What happened? What is this?

964
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:32,100
Are you okay?

965
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:36,120
Where did you go?
Why didn't you come back?

966
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:38,430
- I was so worried about you.
- Who's that?

967
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:46,050
We work together.

968
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:47,930
Hey.

969
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:51,650
- We gotta go.
- Okay. Come on. Come on, come on.

970
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,700
Hey, hey!
You guys can't just be walking up in...

971
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:59,990
Simon Masrani's death was a tragedy.

972
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:04,600
The new mission
is to prevent further loss of life.

973
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:06,130
Who are these guys?

974
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,470
I'm glad you asked.

975
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:10,450
You're all relieved of duty.

976
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,460
There's a new team on the ground.

977
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,630
Lowery, I'm on my way back to you.

978
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,760
That's a bad idea.

979
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:38,500
The board assigned emergency ops
to INGEN's private security division.

980
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:40,240
This guy Hoskins is in charge.

981
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:44,580
And he has this insane plan
to use the Raptors to hunt the Indominus.

982
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:46,560
What do you mean "use the Raptors"?

983
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:49,020
Son of a bitch!

984
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:51,180
You shouldn't say "bitch."

985
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:54,830
Take the kids. Get them someplace safe.

986
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:13,920
- You got this! Damn it, drive!
- Go faster!

987
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,850
This does not feel safe.

988
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:22,850
Can we stay with you?

989
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:25,860
I am never leaving you
as long as you live.

990
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,120
No, no, no. Him.

991
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:30,430
Yeah, definitely him.

992
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:59,770
Hey! Right here.

993
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,790
Right here.

994
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,150
She looks at what she wants.

995
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,600
Usually what she wants to eat.

996
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:30,080
The mother hen has finally arrived.

997
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:36,440
Get the hell out of here
and stay away from my animals.

998
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:40,530
Hoskins, you wanted this to happen,
you son of a bitch!

999
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:41,390
Oh, Jesus!

1000
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:46,110
How many more people have to die before
this mission starts to make sense to you?

1001
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,410
It's not a mission.

1002
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:48,740
It's a field test.

1003
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:51,780
This is an INGEN situation now.

1004
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:56,020
Okay, there are gonna be cruise ships
that show up here at first light.

1005
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:57,800
Everybody's gonna get off this island.

1006
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:01,810
You're gonna watch a news story tomorrow
about how you all saved lives.

1007
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,070
No, no, no, better yet...

1008
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,970
how your animals saved lives.

1009
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,820
They've never been out of containment.
It's crazy.

1010
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:12,650
Let's move it out!

1011
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,060
This is happening!

1012
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:18,270
With or without you.

1013
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,430
We know that she is in sector five.

1014
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:27,410
This is a game we call hide-and-seek.
It's a scent drill.

1015
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:29,600
We've done it about a thousand times
with these animals.

1016
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:33,410
When they get on target,
and they will get on target...

1017
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,260
wait to engage.

1018
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:38,440
Velociraptors are pack hunters.

1019
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:40,950
They like to herd the
animal into a kill zone.

1020
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,480
That's when we take our shot.

1021
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:46,120
Get a clear shot, wait on my command
and give her everything you got.

1022
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:48,290
We got one good target, gentlemen.

1023
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:51,190
Do not shoot my Raptors.

1024
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,650
Please.

1025
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,160
Easy, Blue.

1026
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,400
Easy.

1027
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,150
Attagirl.

1028
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,090
You don't scare me.

1029
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:06,300
Owen.

1030
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,580
Are they safe?

1031
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:15,210
No, they're not.

1032
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,350
What are their names?

1033
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,970
Well, you got Charlie.

1034
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:22,210
There's Echo. Here is Delta.

1035
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:26,380
This one's called Blue.
She's the beta.

1036
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:27,910
Who's the alpha?

1037
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,850
You're looking at him, kid.

1038
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:35,790
See?

1039
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,510
Totally safe.

1040
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,790
All right, get in. Come on.

1041
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,260
Get in there.

1042
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,830
If you need me, I'll be right up front.

1043
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,550
Just open that window.

1044
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,040
Okay?

1045
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,530
Put your seatbelts on.

1046
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:58,700
Okay, so just...

1047
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:01,680
hold hands.

1048
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,100
Nothing's getting in here, right?

1049
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,230
Hey.

1050
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:34,330
Do you remember that ghost at the old
house? Remember the one in the garage?

1051
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:37,130
I protected you, right?

1052
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:43,500
You made a battle axe
out of a ruler and a paper plate.

1053
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:47,710
Yeah. See, nothing is gonna get you
while I'm around, okay?

1054
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,230
But you're not always gonna be around.

1055
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,730
Yeah, well...

1056
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:55,710
Hey.

1057
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:59,290
We're brothers, okay?

1058
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:02,580
We'll always be brothers and
we'll always come back to one another.

1059
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:06,840
No matter what.

1060
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:09,210
No matter what?

1061
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,060
No matter what.

1062
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:34,390
Awesome.

1063
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:48,540
Here we go.

1064
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:02,420
Your boyfriend's a badass.

1065
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:17,860
Imagine if we had these puppies
in Tora Bora.

1066
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,650
Are you recording this thing?

1067
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,280
They're slowing down.

1068
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:38,990
They got something.

1069
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,050
You know what? No, no, no.
You guys are not gonna watch this.

1070
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:01,330
Keep the window closed.

1071
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:39,000
Something's wrong.

1072
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:41,610
They're communicating.

1073
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:51,870
I know why they wouldn't tell us
what it's made of.

1074
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,130
Why?

1075
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,420
That thing's part Raptor.

1076
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:09,960
What's taking them so long?
Light it up!

1077
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:10,970
Engage!

1078
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:26,830
Oh, my God.

1079
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:39,930
Watch your six.

1080
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:42,460
Raptors got a new alpha.

1081
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:05,880
To the vehicles now!

1082
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:07,780
Fall back!

1083
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:30,620
No!

1084
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:32,030
Blue!

1085
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,090
Oh, my God.

1086
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,260
Is everybody dead?

1087
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:52,130
No, no, no. Everyone is fine.

1088
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:53,150
Don't lie to him.

1089
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:55,910
He's scared.
It's okay to lie when people are scared.

1090
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,310
I wanna go home.

1091
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,480
Sweetheart, you will, okay? I promise.

1092
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:01,170
Tomorrow you will be home...

1093
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:04,630
and your mother will
never let me see you again.

1094
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,220
Get out of here! Go!

1095
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,040
They're coming!

1096
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:25,480
Just hold on back there.

1097
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:16,610
- Turn it on.
- I don't know how.

1098
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,430
Are you boys okay?

1099
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,790
Hey, did you see that?

1100
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,210
I can't wait to tell Mom.

1101
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,190
Please, no.
Do not tell your mother about that, ever.

1102
01:38:41,170 --> 01:38:43,050
- Owen!
- Owen!

1103
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:49,680
We gotta get indoors. Follow me.

1104
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:58,470
Lowery, we're headed your way.
Call in a chopper.

1105
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:13,920
Everything must be accounted for.

1106
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,950
I want all backup generators online.

1107
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:24,060
Where have you been?

1108
01:39:24,070 --> 01:39:27,420
Change of plans.
Mission took a jog to the left.

1109
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:28,920
I'm taking everything off-site.

1110
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:30,520
The embryos are safe here.

1111
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:32,830
They can live up to eight weeks
on the generators.

1112
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:36,600
No, no. You listen.
The park's gonna be Chapter 11 by morning.

1113
01:39:36,610 --> 01:39:39,340
Okay, our little side project's
about to get a shot in the arm.

1114
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:40,810
I don't want a bunch of
lawyers messing around

1115
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:42,150
with something that
they don't understand.

1116
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:44,260
You get it?

1117
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:47,740
Hey!
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

1118
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:53,590
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like to thank you for your patience.

1119
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:57,610
The next ferry will be
leaving in 45 minutes.

1120
01:39:57,620 --> 01:40:00,130
If you require immediate
medical attention, please

1121
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:02,400
report to the nearest
health service station.

1122
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:04,140
Is this what you had in mind?

1123
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:06,770
Okay, people. We have an
extraction point at the east dock.

1124
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:11,310
Hey.

1125
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:13,450
They said we had to evacuate.
There's a boat.

1126
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:14,930
You coming?

1127
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:24,850
Someone has to stay behind.

1128
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:32,340
No. I have a boyfriend.

1129
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:36,160
I didn't know that you guys
were, like, together-together.

1130
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:37,350
We are.

1131
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,810
That's good.
You don't mention him, ever.

1132
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:40,920
No, I'm at work.

1133
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:42,500
No, no, no. Yeah.

1134
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:45,650
- Well...
- Yeah, okay.

1135
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:46,630
- Great.
- Great.

1136
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

1137
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:49,100
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

1138
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:51,040
Okay, bye.

1139
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,540
Where's Hoskins?

1140
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:04,420
He's sending you
and the assets to a secure location.

1141
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:06,340
But our deal is still intact?

1142
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:09,360
Don't worry. You'll be well
taken care of. Let's go!

1143
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:18,650
Thank you for visiting Jurassic World.

1144
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:20,740
We hope you enjoyed your adventure.

1145
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:23,660
Don't forget to visit the gift shop,
and remember...

1146
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:27,350
It's always happy hour at Margaritaville.

1147
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:33,630
Come on, come on. Go inside.

1148
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,150
Control room. That way.

1149
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,470
They evacuated the lab.

1150
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:37,410
What are you doing?

1151
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:40,220
I'm afraid that's
above your pay grade, honey.

1152
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:43,210
Where's Henry?

1153
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:46,160
Dr. Wu works for us.

1154
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:48,880
That's not a real dinosaur.

1155
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:51,800
No, it ain't, kid.

1156
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:56,980
But somebody's gotta make sure
that this company has a future.

1157
01:42:56,990 --> 01:42:58,860
Imagine...

1158
01:42:58,870 --> 01:43:03,300
that one, a fraction of the size...

1159
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:03,830
deadly...

1160
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,220
intelligent...

1161
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:09,530
able to hide from the most advanced
military technology.

1162
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:12,870
A living weapon unlike anything
we've ever seen.

1163
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:18,420
You see? Millions of years of evolution...
what did we learn?

1164
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:22,970
Nature is the gift that just...

1165
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:24,460
Oh, shit!

1166
01:43:27,110 --> 01:43:28,260
Easy.

1167
01:43:29,730 --> 01:43:31,080
Easy, boy.

1168
01:43:31,090 --> 01:43:34,350
Easy. Hey, hey.

1169
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,750
We're on the same side, right?
Right?

1170
01:43:41,710 --> 01:43:42,850
Easy.

1171
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:45,510
Easy.

1172
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,800
I'm on your side.

1173
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,840
No, boys. This way. Come on.

1174
01:43:58,850 --> 01:43:59,850
Come on. Come on.

1175
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:37,320
That's how it is, huh?

1176
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:55,880
Easy.

1177
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,520
Easy.

1178
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:12,850
That's it.

1179
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:23,970
24, 50.

1180
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,020
We need more.

1181
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:28,540
More what?

1182
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:31,610
Teeth. We need more teeth.

1183
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:43,840
Okay, so, you just wait here.

1184
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:46,710
It's gonna be fine.

1185
01:47:35,050 --> 01:47:36,570
Lowery, are you still there?

1186
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:38,510
Hey, where are you?

1187
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,530
I need you to open Paddock 9.

1188
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:42,510
Paddock 9?

1189
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:45,300
You kidding?

1190
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:53,480
Damn it, Lowery, be a man
and do something for once in your life.

1191
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:55,510
Why did you have to make it personal?

1192
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:11,670
Run!

1193
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,340
Go! Go, go!

1194
01:53:41,970 --> 01:53:44,400
Oh, my God, it's your parents.
It's your parents.

1195
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:47,500
Come on, come on.

1196
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:56,440
Are you okay? Oh, baby.

1197
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:04,780
I'm so sorry.

1198
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,360
Are you okay?

1199
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:13,560
Come here.

1200
01:54:15,730 --> 01:54:17,170
Sweetie.

1201
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:36,960
So, what do we do now?

1202
01:54:37,930 --> 01:54:40,230
Probably stick together.

1203
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:43,750
For survival.

1204
01:54:44,305 --> 01:54:50,418
