MINSK
BELARUS

4
00:01:14,238 --> 00:01:15,698
Benji.

5
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,900
Benji, do you copy?

6
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:20,009
Benji.

7
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,441
Oh.
Shit.

8
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:23,908
Where's Ethan?

9
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:25,588
Uh.
I can't talk right now.

10
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:28,019
The package is on the plane.

11
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:29,614
Yeah, I know.

12
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:33,542
We're currently formulating a plan B
although technically, it's a plan C.

13
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:34,940
This isn't going very well.

14
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,265
I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.

15
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:38,399
Where's Ethan?

16
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:39,877
I don't know.
We're on radio silence.

17
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:42,648
That plane cannot takeoff,
with the package on it.

18
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:44,772
- You understand?
- We're working on it.

19
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,879
Luther?  What the hell
are you doing there?

20
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:48,669
You are supposed to be on
an assignment in Malaysia.

21
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:51,721
I'm in Malaysia, I've been here 2 days.
Benji needed my help.

22
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:55,260
I didn't need help. I just-
I needed assistance, it's a different thing.

23
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:57,604
The package is still
on that plane.

24
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:00,763
We understand the package
is on the plane.

25
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,240
- We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that.

26
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:06,031
We can if the pilot left the
satellite uplink switch on.

27
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,405
- Which he has.
- And how do you access the uplink?

28
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,955
- It involves hacking a Russian satellite.
- I can't authorise that.

29
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:13,797
Which is why
I didn't ask permission.

30
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:16,278
We are under investigation
for misconduct.

31
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,699
The package is on-board.
What do you want me to do?

32
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,536
Uh.
Luther.

33
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:32,211
I'm reading a heat bloom, Benji.
The engines are starting.

34
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,795
Yeah.
I'm aware of that.

35
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,333
But I can't do anything until
I'm connected to the satellite.

36
00:02:37,622 --> 00:02:40,501
- Benji, you are connected.
- Okay, Great.

37
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,904
The package is still
on that plane.

38
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:45,810
Shut down the fuel pump.

39
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:47,661
Uh.
Mechanical are lockdown.

40
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:50,846
- What about the electrical system?
- Oh, that might work.

41
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,656
No.
No.

42
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:53,540
- Hydraulics.
- Okay, standby.

43
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:55,550
No, they're encrypted.

44
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,102
Benji, the plane.

45
00:02:58,127 --> 00:02:59,840
Yes!
The package is on the plane!

46
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:01,725
We get it!

47
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:05,267
Can you open the door?

48
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:07,635
- Ethan? Where are you?
- I'm by the plane.

49
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,572
Benji, can you open the door?

50
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:12,326
Uh. Can I open the door?
Uh. Maybe.

51
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:14,863
Open the door when I tell you.

52
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,672
I'm on the plane.
Open the door.

53
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:31,837
How did you
get in the plane?

54
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:34,606
Not in the plane,
I'm on the plane!

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,898
Open the door!

56
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,459
Benji.
Open the door!

57
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:46,015
Yeah-yeah-yeah...
Okay, okay.

58
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:53,890
- Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I am trying.

59
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:10,460
- Come on, Benji.
- Benji, open that door!

60
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,873
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

61
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:21,227
Come on.
Yes, got it.

62
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:27,612
That's the wrong door!

63
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:29,996
Benji, not that door.
The other door.

64
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,620
The other door.
Right. Yes, the other door.

65
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:34,919
Okay, yes, yes.  Sorry, sorry.
My bad, my bad.

66
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,919
Check it out.

67
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:43,967
Alright.
Look, I'm gonna open the para-door.

68
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,817
How's that?

69
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:16,432
Hey.
Hey.

70
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:04,495
LONDON
ENGLAND

71
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,263
We're about to close.

72
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:35,133
I won't be long.

73
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:37,813
You looking for
anything in particular.

74
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,970
Something rare.

75
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:46,263
Let me guess.

76
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,328
Classical.

77
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:50,353
Jazz.

78
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:52,495
- Sax.
- Coltrain.

79
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,691
- Piano.
- Monk.

80
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:57,262
Shadow Wilson on the bass.

81
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:00,048
Shadow Wilson played drums.

82
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:03,140
Know why
they called him Shadow?

83
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:05,843
Because he had a light touch.

84
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,336
You're in luck.

85
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:12,104
I've a first pressing.

86
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,558
It really is you.

87
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,259
I've heard stories.

88
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:29,725
They can't all be true.

89
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:53,252
Good even, Mr. Hunt.

90
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:57,002
The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas.

91
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:59,750
Capable of devastating
a major city.

92
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:01,621
The bodies of the air crew
were found less than

93
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:04,538
24 hours after they
landed in Damascus.

94
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:07,580
They were identified as
low level Chechen separatist.

95
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,478
With neither the
access nor the ability

96
00:08:09,503 --> 00:08:12,616
to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.

97
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,359
This would support your suspicion

98
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:17,610
that a shadow organization is
committed to inciting revolution.

99
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:21,819
by enabling acts of terror in
nations friendly to Western interests.

100
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:24,822
IMF suspects this to be the
same shadow organization

101
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:27,105
you have been tracking
for the last year

102
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,493
Also known as the Syndicate.

103
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,897
IMF would be right.

104
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:34,171
Normally, you and your
team would be tasked

105
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:37,162
with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network,

106
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:40,838
but we have taken steps to
ensure that this will not happen.

107
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:43,522
Because, we, are the Syndicate,
Mr. Hunt.

108
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:46,234
And now we know
who you are.

109
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,559
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

110
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:50,209
is to face your fate.

111
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:54,391
Pursue us, you'll be caught.
Resist us, you'll be killed.

112
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:58,565
And you precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.

113
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,909
Good luck, Mr. Hunt.

114
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:04,125
This message will self destruct
in 5 seconds.

115
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:58,748
Mr. Chairman, the IMF's misadventures
date back to my earliest days in the CIA

116
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:03,429
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

117
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:06,440
- And now, more recently a Russian warhead.
- Disarmed Russian warhead.

118
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:09,258
- A Russian nuclear warhead.
- Branded safe by the IMF.

119
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:12,674
Clipped the Transamerica Pyramid
before plunging into the San Francisco bay.

120
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,213
Saving the western atmosphere.

121
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,768
This made possible by IMF
 agents who did willing

122
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:19,904
provide the launch codes
to a known terrorist.

123
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,624
Do I have that right, agent Brandt?

124
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:27,490
I can neither confirm nor deny details of any
such operation without Secretary's approval.

125
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:30,436
This was the same week after
IMF infiltrated the Kremlin.

126
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:32,927
Here's the Kremlin before.

127
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:36,423
And the Kremlin after.

128
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:41,077
I can neither confirm nor
deny details of any operation...

129
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:42,856
Without the Secretary's approval.
Yes, we know.

130
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:45,379
In fact, until this panel
appoints a new Secretary,

131
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,821
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, agent Brandt?

132
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,385
Well.
I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.

133
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,128
Mr. Chairman, the so call
Impossible Missions Force

134
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,608
is not just a rogue organization,
it is an outdated one.

135
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:59,505
A throwback to an era without
transparency and without oversight.

136
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,936
- Mr. Chairman.
- The time has come to dissolve the IMF.

137
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:06,104
- Mr. Chairman.
- And transfer the salvageable assets to the CIA.

138
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:09,427
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.

139
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,866
- Now, are its methods unorthodox?
  Yes.
- Mr. Chairman.

140
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:15,051
Are it's results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

141
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,659
- But without the IMF, to be force...
- There'll be order and stability.

142
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,847
Without the IMF...

143
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:26,151
This panel recognizes the IMF's
contribution to global security.

144
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:29,474
But the events laid out by
CIA director Hunley

145
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:32,629
also show a pattern of
 once and brinkmanship

146
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:35,460
and a total disregard for protocol.

147
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:36,706
From where I sit,

148
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:40,700
you unorthodox methods are
indistinguishable from chance.

149
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,804
And your results,
perfect or not,

150
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,548
looked suspiciously like luck.

151
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:52,350
I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out.

152
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:33,319
What are you doing here?

153
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:35,419
Huh?

154
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,098
I said: "What are you doing here?"

155
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:51,601
What does he see in you, I wonder.

156
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:53,379
Who is he?

157
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,845
I want to see what is done.

158
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:03,231
Why don't you
take off the cuffs.

159
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:05,425
And I'll show you.

160
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,223
Vinter.

161
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:12,631
You know who I am?

162
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:14,730
Janik Vinter.

163
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:18,747
They call you,
the bone doctor.

164
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,939
The funny thing is.

165
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:26,072
You're officially declared dead,
3 years ago.

166
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,256
Nice shoes by the way.

167
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:31,595
Not his.

168
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,520
Yours.

169
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:42,522
We have instructions to talk,

170
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:43,993
not to kill him.

171
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:47,142
There are men who can be
broken in different ways.

172
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,662
This one's a fighter.

173
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:53,286
He'll die,
before you turn him.

174
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:56,083
Are you worry he's
gonna take your place?

175
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:11,085
You should go,
before it gets ugly.

176
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:15,729
Yeah, he's right.

177
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:17,775
You should go.

178
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:34,641
Now, let's see how tough you are.

179
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:37,772
You, Janik.

180
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:03,077
We've never met before, right?

181
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,607
Follow me.

182
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:16,334
Give me the gun.

183
00:17:19,595 --> 00:17:22,469
- What're you doing?
- I can't leave.

184
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:24,562
Look. You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

185
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:26,768
We didn't kill them.
You did.

186
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:30,376
I tried to stop you.
You got away.

187
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:33,511
Who are you?

188
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:36,650
You better hurry now.
Good luck.

189
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:38,341
No, wait.
Wait!

190
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:39,496
Where is he?

191
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:42,009
He's heading towards north passage.
He has closed the gate.

192
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:45,285
Run. He's getting away.
Hurry!

193
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,749
- Stack-com 7.
- Western Europe unsecured.

194
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:02,244
- Designator.
- Bravo Echo One One.

195
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:04,025
Connecting.

196
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,369
- This is Brandt.
- Go secure.

197
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:08,646
Go.

198
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,061
London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.

199
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:15,068
Agent placed is down.
Request immediate extraction.

200
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,097
What happened?
Who breached London?

201
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:18,775
Do you've anything to go on?

202
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:22,614
A face. He wanted something.
Not information.

203
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:25,719
He could've kill me,
but he didn't.

204
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,400
- Okay, what do you think it means.
- The Syndicate is real.

205
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:32,187
They know who we're,
how we operate.

206
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,928
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

207
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:40,088
Just focus operations on gathering any available
Intel regarding formal covert operatives.

208
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:42,148
It doesn't matter what
country or agency.

209
00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:44,613
Just as long as they are dead
Or presumed dead.

210
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:49,398
Start with Janik Vinter.
He's also known as the bone doctor.

211
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:51,709
- I can't do that.
- What?

212
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:53,745
What're you talking about?

213
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,986
The Committee has shut us down.

214
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,183
Operations are to be
handled over to the CIA.

215
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,941
There is no more IMF.

216
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,739
I've been ordered
to bring everyone in.

217
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,620
- Ethan.
- I understand.

218
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,008
- Ethan.
- I understand, Brandt.

219
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,994
We didn't have this conversation.

220
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:14,155
I disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

221
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,743
If I'm dead or alive.

222
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:18,319
This man you saw.
Can you find him?

223
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:22,162
I won't stop until I do.

224
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:25,787
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

225
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:27,447
Make it count.

226
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,165
Brandt.

227
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:49,687
Since we are going
to be work together,

228
00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:52,370
I want you to choose your
next works very carefully.

229
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:53,512
Where is Hunt?

230
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:55,462
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt.

231
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,243
I have no way of contacting him.

232
00:19:57,268 --> 00:20:00,073
He's deep cover. Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

233
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,405
Let's cut the bull.

234
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,452
You know who we are.
You know what we are capable of.

235
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:09,290
How come the CIA has never discovered
any actual Intel regarding this Syndicate.

236
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:11,971
- What are you implying?
- Not implying, stating.

237
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:14,259
Leveling an accusation actually.

238
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:17,870
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

239
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:20,502
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination.

240
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:23,809
Created to justify
the IMF's existence.

241
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,183
I'm going to find him, Brandt.
And when I do,

242
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:32,600
he will be called upon to answer for every
wanton active mayhem he's responsible for.

243
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:36,640
Welcome to the CIA.

244
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:39,611
You'll never find him.

245
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:41,481
Set your watch, Brandt.

246
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,998
Ethan Hunt is living his
last day as a free man.

247
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:48,044
6 months later

248
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:51,133
HAVANA,
CUBA

249
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,851
CIA
LANGLEY, VIRGINIA

250
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:01,015
All right, everybody.
Heads up.

251
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,713
This is it.

252
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,142
Alpha team prep.
Standing by.

253
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,181
- Execute.
- Langley brimstone, go.

254
00:21:07,206 --> 00:21:09,602
I say again.
We are a go.

255
00:22:05,696 --> 00:22:08,235
Langley, there's nobody here.

256
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,178
Langley brimstone.
Face the north wall.

257
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:30,253
ANOTHER ONE VANISHES
HERE IS FLIGHT 606?

258
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:32,783
FIRE GUTS CHEMICAL
WEAPONS PLANT

259
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:35,913
WORLD BANK
DECLARES CRISIS

260
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:12,142
B. Dunn

261
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:18,354
VIENNA OPERA

262
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:20,322
YOU'VE
WON!

263
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,563
Dunn.

264
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:30,711
Is it that time already.
Okay.

265
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:34,497
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

266
00:23:34,522 --> 00:23:36,195
I know and I'm gonna
answer truthfully.

267
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,756
And then you gonna ask
me to lie intentionally.

268
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:41,742
- State your name.
- The King of Norway.

269
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:43,732
See, that's a lie.

270
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,525
I'm actually third in line
to the throne.

271
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,187
My brother was...

272
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:49,687
- Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?
- Why would he contact me?

273
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:52,548
Hunt has resurfaced.
This time in Cuba.

274
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:56,529
He...
left these behind.

275
00:23:56,848 --> 00:23:59,034
Tell me what you
make of them.

276
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,939
I don't know.
He's taken up scrap booking?

277
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:02,842
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

278
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:05,732
All of them are either
missing or dead, everyone.

279
00:24:05,757 --> 00:24:07,355
All of them were
government agents.

280
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,396
Russian, French, British, 
Israelis, you name it.

281
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:13,686
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no problem collecting them.

282
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:16,759
And he always seems
to be a step ahead of us.

283
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:19,146
- I wonder how?
- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?

284
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:21,370
That thought had cross my mind.

285
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,092
6 months, I have been here.

286
00:24:23,123 --> 00:24:27,146
Sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

287
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:31,222
I had decrypted, processed, passed
more data than anyone in my section.

288
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:33,188
And yet every week,
you hold me in here.

289
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:36,166
And you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

290
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:39,714
And today,
you haven't answered it.

291
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:45,319
You seem to thinks I have
some kind of obligation to him.

292
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:47,939
Okay, nothing could be
further from the truth.

293
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:54,676
Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field,
and I'm stuck here answering for it

294
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:57,167
We're not friends.

295
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:01,146
I owe him nothing.

296
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:08,222
That'll be all, Dunn.

297
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:08,995
Welcome to Vienna, Benji.
Missed me?

298
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,089
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

299
00:26:11,114 --> 00:26:13,278
No act.. you know what? 
Please, don't tell me that,

300
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:16,269
because it's just another thing I would have
to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

301
00:26:16,294 --> 00:26:18,491
Everything is going to be fine.
Just keep walking.

302
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:20,789
But, make sure you're
not being follow.ed

303
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:22,375
Oh. I didn't win those
opera tickets, did I?

304
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,094
No, I'm afraid not

305
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,793
- So, where do we meet?
- We don't.

306
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,667
For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.

307
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:30,283
You have mail.

308
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,274
- Who is he?
- That's what we're here to find out.

309
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,416
What I do know, is he's our only
possible link to the Syndicate

310
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,415
and I have reason to believe that
he's going to be here tonight.

311
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,631
But I can't find him alone.
Are you in?

312
00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:45,986
- Are you in?
- Yes, of course. Of course.

313
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:49,478
- So, what's the play?
- Simple. You find him, we tag him.

314
00:26:49,503 --> 00:26:52,402
- I follow him wherever he goes.
- And after that?

315
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:55,485
After that you're on a plane,
back at work Monday morning.

316
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,821
- No one is the wiser.
- What? That's it?

317
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:00,416
You're in enough
danger as it is.

318
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:03,033
I didn't want to involve you
this much but I had no choice.

319
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:04,720
Whoa. If you're gonna bring me
all this way,

320
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:08,451
 you could at least give me something
a little be more...you know, dramatic.

321
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:11,457
Benji, we are trying
to keep a low profile.

322
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:15,140
You want drama, 
go to the opera.

323
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:46,785
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Yes, I am.

324
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:56,135
Am I correct in assuming that is
the Chancellor of Austria?

325
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,662
- Yes, you are.
- Did you know he's going to be here?

326
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:01,346
- No
- Right.

327
00:28:01,371 --> 00:28:03,694
Well. We have a European
Heads of State here,

328
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:07,231
at the same time as we're
looking for a nefarious terrorist.

329
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:10,794
- And I'm sure the two things
are completely unrelated.
- Benji.

330
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:15,744
- Mean while I'll try and overlook the fact that
you're an international fugitive wanted by the CIA.
- Benji.

331
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:19,328
- And this little unsanctioned operation
is tenement-ed treasonous.
- Benji.

332
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:20,673
Because as you stated earlier,

333
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,511
I will be back in my desk
on Monday morning,

334
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:25,431
playing video games and no one
will be any be the wiser.

335
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:27,182
- The show's about to start, Benji.
- Right.

336
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:30,048
- Just take your position,
tell me what you see.
- Okay.

337
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:32,378
Nice tux, by the way.

338
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:53,281
Stage is set.
Ready lights.

339
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:55,490
Ready lights.

340
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:04,716
The final preparations ready.

341
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:06,991
Stay alert, please.

342
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:45,225
Join the IMF. See the world,
on a monitor

343
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,051
in a closet.

344
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:31,149
Okay, I have eyes.

345
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:32,935
Searching

346
00:31:34,516 --> 00:31:38,099
- Talk to me, Benji.
- Nothing yet. Standby.

347
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:44,250
I know you're here.
Where're you.

348
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:51,961
Uh Ethan, I might have something for you.
Can't confirm.

349
00:31:51,986 --> 00:31:54,814
- Where?
- Backstage, I will direct you

350
00:32:01,777 --> 00:32:06,137
Take the door on your left.
He should be right in front of you.

351
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:49,872
Benji, did you see that?
- See what?

352
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:51,582
A woman.

353
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:53,359
What woman?
Where're you?

354
00:32:53,384 --> 00:32:55,264
I can't see you.

355
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:16,123
- What happened?
- I don't know

356
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:32,251
Ethan, do you copy?
Ethan, come in.

357
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,921
Ethan, the lighting booth.
Ethan, do you copy?

358
00:37:56,946 --> 00:37:58,442
Oh god.

359
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,259
It's a flash wound.

360
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:03,434
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

361
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:13,404
Surround the building.
Secure the exits.

362
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:17,488
I've a way out.
Interested?

363
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,330
Lead the way.

364
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:31,572
- Anything you want to tell me?
- No, not right now.

365
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:34,655
- How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me.

366
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,564
What's next?

367
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:47,429
Alright.

368
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:49,318
There.

369
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,846
Shoes.

370
00:40:59,027 --> 00:41:00,805
Shoes, please.

371
00:41:56,868 --> 00:41:58,287
If anything happens to you...

372
00:41:58,312 --> 00:42:01,138
Nothing is going to 
happen to me.

373
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,471
Stop the car!

374
00:42:11,343 --> 00:42:13,027
Get in.

375
00:42:14,522 --> 00:42:16,331
Go go go.

376
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:26,811
What the...!
She tried to shoot me.

377
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,509
It doesn't make her
a bad person.

378
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:32,254
- I'm gonna have to search you.
- You have to let me go.

379
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:33,798
Oh oh.
Not a chance.

380
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:37,458
I assume you're deep cover back in London
but isn't this taking the role a little too far.

381
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:38,893
Hang on a minute,
you know her?

382
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:40,787
Oh.
We haven't formerly introduced.

383
00:42:40,812 --> 00:42:43,205
But I am pretty sure
she's British intelligence.

384
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,166
Ilsa Faust.
You're Ethan Hunt.

385
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:50,158
And... that shade is
very hard to find.

386
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:53,341
- What were you doing at the opera tonight?
- What? Aside from killing the Chancellor.

387
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:55,668
Saving your life in London 
put me in a tight spot

388
00:42:55,693 --> 00:42:57,523
with some very dangerous people.

389
00:42:57,548 --> 00:43:00,018
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

390
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:01,735
Ha. So, you admit
that you killed him?

391
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,901
I went through the motion,
that's not the same thing.

392
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:07,967
You thought you put him in the hospital,
take him out of harm's way.

393
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:09,681
The same thing
you tried to do.

394
00:43:09,706 --> 00:43:12,130
You're not gonna believe that, are you?
What about the rest of her team?

395
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:16,007
You means those other 2 idiots?
I can only assumed they were redundancies.

396
00:43:16,031 --> 00:43:20,071
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

397
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,765
the other one to kill you.
A test.

398
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,693
Second one I failed,
thanks to you.

399
00:43:24,718 --> 00:43:28,105
And the car bomb 
was insurance.

400
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,073
We have a tail.

401
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,220
Who is he?

402
00:43:37,245 --> 00:43:39,402
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

403
00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:42,320
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you've to let me out.

404
00:43:42,345 --> 00:43:44,350
They're closing.

405
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:47,856
This has to look like an escape.
So, you just throw me out anywhere.

406
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:50,341
Tell me who he is.

407
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,673
Oh!

408
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:55,305
Oh. Change of plan.
Throw her out!

409
00:43:56,986 --> 00:43:59,593
You have everything
you need to find me.

410
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:19,053
Less than 24 hours after we interviewed
Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt

411
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:21,605
He was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

412
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:24,905
And within 6 hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

413
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,372
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defendant.

414
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:30,522
But to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

415
00:44:30,523 --> 00:44:35,033
Consider the moment, the possibility that
Ethan's investigation lead him to the opera.

416
00:44:35,058 --> 00:44:36,729
And he's the one with
the actionable intelligence.

417
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,874
In any case, finding Hunt
is no longer our pet project.

418
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:45,168
The Special Activity Division
will now have full discretion.

419
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:47,205
You mean shoot to kill?

420
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,887
Whether Hunt lives or dies.
It's entirely up to him.

421
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,895
New identity, passport,
cash, road map.

422
00:45:54,928 --> 00:45:56,498
There's a change of clothes
in that bag, right there.

423
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:59,417
Everything you need to
make it to DC undetected.

424
00:45:59,442 --> 00:46:02,011
Once you're there,
you'll have to inform on me.

425
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:04,023
- I'm suppose... what? Sorry, what?
- Tell the truth.

426
00:46:04,024 --> 00:46:06,979
You came to Vienna believing
you won 2 tickets to the opera.

427
00:46:07,004 --> 00:46:10,246
And I attempted to recruit you into
assassinating the Chancellor, you refused.

428
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:13,631
- That is not the true.
- Your life depends on them believing you, Benji.

429
00:46:13,656 --> 00:46:15,961
It'll go easier if you tell them
what they want to hear.

430
00:46:15,986 --> 00:46:19,624
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

431
00:46:27,797 --> 00:46:30,123
You recognized anyone?

432
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:45,645
- Him.
- He's former KSA, German intelligence.

433
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,827
Missing, presumed dead.

434
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:50,123
He was at the opera tonight.

435
00:46:50,148 --> 00:46:51,696
This one too.

436
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:55,161
- Former Mossad.
- Let me guess. Presumed dead.

437
00:46:55,268 --> 00:46:57,786
Tonight, I made it official.

438
00:46:58,638 --> 00:47:01,113
I was looking for him
in Bosporus.

439
00:47:01,138 --> 00:47:05,078
The same day a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

440
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:08,627
He slipped away again in Jakarta.

441
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,770
Hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

442
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,697
with 236 passengers.

443
00:47:15,217 --> 00:47:17,164
I just missed him
in the Philippines.

444
00:47:17,189 --> 00:47:22,287
Right before a fired petrochemical plant
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

445
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:27,205
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

446
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:32,224
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

447
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,746
That fire bank corrupted
a global arms cooperation.

448
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:40,254
That wreck triggered a civil war.

449
00:47:41,593 --> 00:47:43,827
These are no accidents.

450
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:49,257
They're links in a chain. The work of
a single organization, the Syndicate.

451
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:50,667
A rogue nation.

452
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:53,796
Trained to do what we do.
Inbuilt with a new sense of purpose.

453
00:47:53,821 --> 00:47:56,150
Destroy the system that created them.

454
00:47:56,175 --> 00:47:58,731
Regardless if who's in the way.

455
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:01,556
An anti-IMF.

456
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:05,253
And since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

457
00:48:05,278 --> 00:48:07,979
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement

458
00:48:08,003 --> 00:48:10,126
The start of a new phase.

459
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:14,527
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

460
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:17,331
He was there.

461
00:48:17,934 --> 00:48:19,084
Everytime.

462
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:22,221
Just like he was there tonight.
I'm sure of it.

463
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,898
I don't know who he is,
or where he's from.

464
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:28,038
How he's funded

465
00:48:28,063 --> 00:48:30,174
But I know he's the key.

466
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,714
Ethan, this is what I sign up for.

467
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:35,062
- Let me help you find him.
- That's why I brought you here.

468
00:48:35,087 --> 00:48:37,504
In the first place.
And look what happened.

469
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:39,308
I can't protect you.

470
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,289
That's why I need you to leave.

471
00:48:41,314 --> 00:48:44,544
It's not your decision
to make, Ethan.

472
00:48:44,569 --> 00:48:46,155
I'm a field agent.

473
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,027
I know the risks.
More than that, I'm your friend.

474
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:51,080
No matter what I... 
tell the polygraph every week.

475
00:48:51,105 --> 00:48:54,050
Now you called me because
you needed my help.

476
00:48:54,075 --> 00:48:57,282
And you still do.
So, I'm staying.

477
00:48:57,307 --> 00:49:00,189
And that's all we're
gonna say about that.

478
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:07,535
- Okay
- Good

479
00:49:09,124 --> 00:49:11,108
Where do we start?

480
00:49:12,443 --> 00:49:14,091
Ilsa.

481
00:49:16,094 --> 00:49:18,738
Right.
And how do we find her?

482
00:49:18,763 --> 00:49:21,197
She said we've
everything we need.

483
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,809
We had an agreement.

484
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,685
You send me to do
a job, I'd do it.

485
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,663
- But my way, not yours.
- When did I deviate?

486
00:50:07,688 --> 00:50:09,849
You put 2 more gunman
at the opera tonight.

487
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,496
One of them try to kill me.

488
00:50:11,521 --> 00:50:12,639
You missed.

489
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:15,261
I missed because Ethan Hunt
was there looking for you.

490
00:50:15,286 --> 00:50:18,762
Ethan Hunt is in Vienna because
you allow him escape in London.

491
00:50:18,787 --> 00:50:22,920
Vinter would've kill him in London
and that's not what you asked for.

492
00:50:22,945 --> 00:50:25,770
Twice now
you've let him slipped away.

493
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:28,469
Curious.

494
00:50:28,494 --> 00:50:31,970
Are you questioning
my loyalty or my ability.

495
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:35,207
- Can't decide.
- I've told you before.

496
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,425
Trust me or kill me.

497
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,433
But If you're going to kill me,
be the man.

498
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,727
Do it yourself.

499
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,726
Did he say anything?

500
00:51:14,645 --> 00:51:19,489
- He knows about Morocco.
- What did he know about Morocco?

501
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:23,878
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

502
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,368
Find him, please.

503
00:51:27,953 --> 00:51:29,842
He'll find me.

504
00:51:30,728 --> 00:51:33,010
I've him seen to that.

505
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:38,913
Well, that's interesting

506
00:51:38,938 --> 00:51:40,641
- What is it?
- It's a SCIF.

507
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:43,501
Secure Computer Facility offline,
ultra-contained.

508
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:45,641
It's impossible to hack in
from the outside.

509
00:51:45,642 --> 00:51:48,186
It's essentially a digital
safety deposit box.

510
00:51:48,211 --> 00:51:51,878
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

511
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:56,165
- Where's it located?
- Morocco.

512
00:51:57,516 --> 00:51:59,370
Morocco.

513
00:52:00,819 --> 00:52:03,980
CASABLANCA
MOROCCO

514
00:53:14,717 --> 00:53:18,483
Now, what brings you
gentlemen to Casablanca?

515
00:53:48,078 --> 00:53:52,259
- Good to see you
- What couldn't you tell me over the telephone?

516
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:56,349
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

517
00:53:56,374 --> 00:53:59,260
We believe that Ethan
and Benji were there.

518
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:02,904
Huntley's handed this over
to Special Activities Division.

519
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:06,442
We need to find Ethan
before they do.

520
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:09,211
And that's where you come in.

521
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:13,661
- Not interested.
- Okay. Look, Luther.

522
00:54:13,686 --> 00:54:17,937
Look, man. I know Ethan.
I don't know you.

523
00:54:18,251 --> 00:54:21,237
All I know about you is that
you chose to work for Hunley.

524
00:54:21,263 --> 00:54:24,891
Yeah, all I know about you
is you chose to resign.

525
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:27,637
You don't have to
worry about Ethan.

526
00:54:27,662 --> 00:54:30,716
- They'll never catch him
- No, they're not going to catch him. No.

527
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:33,112
This is the CIA, this is Hunley
we're talking about.

528
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:36,620
Thing are out of control
And they're going to kill him.

529
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:40,470
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

530
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:44,321
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

531
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:53,464
You need to understand something.

532
00:54:54,243 --> 00:54:56,784
Ethan is my friend

533
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,184
And if I have 1 second of doubt
whose side you're on.

534
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:06,043
I believe you

535
00:55:06,988 --> 00:55:09,014
- Alright.
- Alright.

536
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,463
- What do I have to go on?
- Not much.

537
00:55:12,488 --> 00:55:14,669
And not a lot of time.

538
00:55:16,008 --> 00:55:20,898
His name is Solomon Lane.
He created the Syndicate.

539
00:55:20,923 --> 00:55:22,914
Where does he come from?

540
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,176
He's former British intelligence.

541
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,980
Well. If British intelligence
knows the Syndicate exist,

542
00:55:29,005 --> 00:55:31,189
why don't they
just tell the CIA?

543
00:55:31,214 --> 00:55:36,457
Because they don't want anyone knowing
the Syndicate was created by one of their own.

544
00:55:36,776 --> 00:55:39,608
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust.

545
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:42,886
And eventually identifying
the members of his organization.

546
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:45,420
For the first time in 2 years,

547
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:47,907
I'm close to knowing
who they are.

548
00:55:47,932 --> 00:55:52,476
Lane had a ledger. It contain
the identities of his operatives,

549
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:56,461
his terrorist associates, the entire
inner workings of the Syndicate.

550
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,668
One of his agents stole it
hoping to blackmail him.

551
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:03,800
He kept it in a secure computer
facility for safe keeping.

552
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:06,603
He died being interrogated
for the access code.

553
00:56:06,628 --> 00:56:09,564
Leaving Lane with a serious problem.

554
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:17,251
So the key to crushing Lane is sitting in a
computer just waiting for someone to take it?

555
00:56:17,497 --> 00:56:21,246
So why hasn't Lane just
send someone to steal it?

556
00:56:21,348 --> 00:56:25,797
Oh, he has.
He sent me.

557
00:56:25,926 --> 00:56:27,815
And I can tell you.

558
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:30,826
It's impossible.

559
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:37,769
The facility is hidden beneath the
local power plant under military guard.

560
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:43,197
And the only way to download the ledger is through
the central computer terminal located there.

561
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:47,464
To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gates.

562
00:56:47,953 --> 00:56:51,444
Access the elevator with fingerprint recognition

563
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:55,350
And open 3 separate combination locks.

564
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,519
Well, that's easy. We just impersonate the
agent who stole the ledger in the first place.

565
00:57:03,544 --> 00:57:06,368
And....
I get to wear a mask.

566
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:32,588
Unfortunately, even if you can make
it through every other security measure

567
00:57:32,613 --> 00:57:34,135
you won't beat the last one.

568
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,426
That's because it's
protected by gait analysis.

569
00:57:36,451 --> 00:57:38,673
A step beyond facial recognition.

570
00:57:38,698 --> 00:57:41,466
These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,

571
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:45,918
how he talks, how he moves,
right down to his facial takes.

572
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:55,181
So, what you're saying is,
no mask can beat it.

573
00:57:55,206 --> 00:57:56,650
We're busted before we could
even get into the vault.

574
00:57:56,675 --> 00:58:00,766
And I wind up in a Morocco jail playing
mommies and daddies without a mother strangler.

575
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,873
Okay, I don't get
to wear a mask.

576
00:58:02,898 --> 00:58:05,843
- And there's no other way into the computer lab?
- No other way in.

577
00:58:05,868 --> 00:58:08,216
- Air Shaft?
- 6 inch diameter pipe.

578
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:11,867
- Foundation?
- 12 feet of concrete, top and bottom.

579
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,569
- Electrical conduit?
- Bottom line is,

580
00:58:13,594 --> 00:58:15,261
there's no way into
that terminal unless

581
00:58:15,286 --> 00:58:19,372
your profile is pre-installed
in the security system.

582
00:58:20,028 --> 00:58:21,667
Profile?

583
00:58:22,243 --> 00:58:23,755
Where're the profile stored?

584
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,882
All security data is stored
offline in the liquid cooler aid.

585
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,984
Here, inside the torus,
liquid cooled.

586
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:32,907
You mean that thing
is under water?

587
00:58:32,932 --> 00:58:35,085
- Yes.
- Yes.

588
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,190
Okay.

589
00:58:36,215 --> 00:58:40,326
So, to get the ledger, one of us
needs to enter the  torus

590
00:58:40,925 --> 00:58:43,635
and change the security profile.

591
00:58:44,913 --> 00:58:48,667
So that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.

592
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:54,043
- That's the only way.
- That's the only way.

593
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,319
Can I get in through there.

594
00:58:56,344 --> 00:58:58,568
- What's that?
- That's the service hatch.

595
00:58:58,593 --> 00:59:02,137
It can only be opened from the inside
If you try and open it from the outside,

596
00:59:02,162 --> 00:59:05,526
you'll be hit with 70 000
gallons of pressurized water.

597
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:08,844
- Where does the water come from?
- Desalinized seawater flows through the intake.

598
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:11,199
in the pipeline.
And before you ask.

599
00:59:11,224 --> 00:59:16,563
The system is designed to shut down
automatically if any metal enters the intake.

600
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:18,727
No oxygen tanks.

601
00:59:20,513 --> 00:59:24,960
Alright. Well, how long will it take to free swim
from the intake to the service hatch.

602
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:27,271
2 minutes.
With the current at full power.

603
00:59:27,296 --> 00:59:29,895
Well. Then, you just have to hold
your breath for 2 minutes.

604
00:59:29,921 --> 00:59:33,791
- What about installing the security profile?
- Well. That's gonna be like a minute tops.

605
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:35,689
So, I have to hold my breath
for 3 minutes?

606
00:59:35,714 --> 00:59:36,973
You can do that.

607
00:59:36,998 --> 00:59:39,224
But I think you're overlooking,
is the physical exertion.

608
00:59:39,249 --> 00:59:42,360
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

609
00:59:42,385 --> 00:59:43,905
Don't worry about him.
Alright.

610
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:47,599
All he has to do is install the fake profile
before I get to the gait analysis.

611
00:59:47,624 --> 00:59:50,015
You said it yourself,
it's the only way

612
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,390
That doesn't sound impossible.

613
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,491
Satellite over-watch
covering all 7 continents,

614
00:59:58,516 --> 01:00:02,735
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

615
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,577
So, how are we suppose to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

616
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:09,391
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her.

617
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:11,263
What do you mean?

618
01:00:11,765 --> 01:00:15,389
These sketches,
what do you see?

619
01:00:16,568 --> 01:00:20,149
Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guys is.

620
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:24,777
But this woman,
he knows her.

621
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:26,630
He trust her.

622
01:00:26,655 --> 01:00:29,309
I'm betting that if he's not
already with her, he's on his way.

623
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,832
Find her, find Ethan.

624
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:33,302
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition of a sketch.

625
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:37,411
For mere mortals, no.
For me, I could've done this at home.

626
01:00:37,436 --> 01:00:39,193
Alright.

627
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,855
- How long is this going to take?
- Found her.

628
01:00:48,254 --> 01:00:52,675
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

629

630
01:00:53,364 --> 01:00:55,609
<font color="#ff8080">DISAVOWED</font>
- What the hell?

631
01:00:56,276 --> 01:00:58,737
She's bad news.

632
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:22,535
- Card.
- Hello.

633
01:01:27,136 --> 01:01:28,761
Sorry

634
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:01,968
- Your card is not working.
- Benji, we're in.

635
01:02:01,993 --> 01:02:04,225
<font color="#b0ffb0">(Released)</font>

636
01:02:05,957 --> 01:02:07,668
Thank you.

637
01:02:45,019 --> 01:02:48,189
One more time.
You have 3 minutes.

638
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:51,346
2.5 minutes to switch
the security profile.

639
01:02:51,371 --> 01:02:54,483
30 seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

640
01:02:54,508 --> 01:02:56,476
Remember, conserve oxygen.

641
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:59,223
Don't move a muscle
if you don't have to.

642
01:03:16,644 --> 01:03:18,876
I'm in the elevator.

643
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:32,289
That current will
carry you to a torus.

644
01:03:32,314 --> 01:03:34,768
Once you're there,
I'll shut it down.

645
01:03:34,793 --> 01:03:38,606
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

646
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,665
And a slightly more
important note,

647
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:43,615
if you haven't switched that profile
before I reach the gait analysis,

648
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,982
I'm dead.

649
01:03:45,007 --> 01:03:47,074
Thank you, Benji.

650
01:04:56,115 --> 01:04:59,620
- What's the problem?
- The cooling system is rebooting

651
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,721
by itself.

652
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,626
Oh.

653
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:27,719
All systems' normal.

654
01:06:27,744 --> 01:06:30,331
Cooling systems at full power.

You're okay.

660
01:10:08,688 --> 01:10:10,381
See.
What did I told you.

661
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:14,107
Difficult, absolutely,
but certainly not impossible...

662
01:10:14,947 --> 01:10:18,678
Jesus, is he alright?
What happened? What happened?

663
01:10:30,337 --> 01:10:32,397
Okay.
Okay.

664
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:34,642
Here.

665
01:10:35,947 --> 01:10:37,540
Hey.

666
01:10:37,565 --> 01:10:39,480
I misjudged you.

667
01:10:44,785 --> 01:10:47,295
Hey, man. Hey.
You okay? How're you doing?

668
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,881
Hey, buddy.

669
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,854
- Benji.
- Yes, it's Benji.

670
01:10:51,879 --> 01:10:53,445
You did good.

671
01:10:53,446 --> 01:10:55,449
You take a moment, alright.
Just-Just take a moment.

672
01:10:55,474 --> 01:10:57,895
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix you.

673
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,828
- You'll be as right as rain.
- What are you doing here?

674
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,917
Look-look-look...

675
01:11:02,918 --> 01:11:04,348
We got it.

676
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:06,373
I knew we'll get it.

677
01:11:08,145 --> 01:11:09,803
Listen. I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay.

678
01:11:09,828 --> 01:11:11,769
I appreciate everything
you do for me, but...

679
01:11:11,794 --> 01:11:14,685
one of these days,
you're gonna take it too far.

680
01:11:16,126 --> 01:11:17,954
We got it.

681
01:11:17,979 --> 01:11:20,720
We're gonna nail that...
Ehh.

682
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:31,454
Wait.
Wait.

683
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,498
I thought you said
you can find him?

684
01:11:35,523 --> 01:11:38,526
I said I could locate him.
You've to find him.

685
01:11:38,551 --> 01:11:40,043
Right.

687
01:11:58,256 --> 01:12:00,256
Where's Hunt?

688
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,558
He's dead.

689
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:08,969
Oh.
That really hurts!

690
01:12:08,994 --> 01:12:10,419
- Can you walk?
- Yes, I can.

691
01:12:10,444 --> 01:12:13,901
We have to get to her
before Lane does.

692
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,347
Whoa-whoa-whoa...
Are you okay to drive?

693
01:13:05,372 --> 01:13:07,379
I mean. A minute ago
you were dead.

694
01:13:07,404 --> 01:13:09,608
What are you talking about?

695
01:13:09,633 --> 01:13:11,965
This is not gonna end well.

696
01:13:22,142 --> 01:13:23,875
There she is!

697
01:13:34,137 --> 01:13:36,641
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

698
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:39,147
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

699
01:13:40,299 --> 01:13:42,976
Ah!
God damn it.

700
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,617
Whoa.

701
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:24,924
Hey?

702
01:14:26,519 --> 01:14:28,109
 I found them.

703
01:14:29,015 --> 01:14:31,011
Oh.
Come on, man.

704
01:14:33,475 --> 01:14:35,265
Shit.

705
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:37,550
It's a high-speed chase.

706
01:14:37,575 --> 01:14:39,808
You just had to get
the 4 by 4, didn't you?

707
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:41,415
Hey, look. Don't blame me.
You chose the car.

708
01:14:41,442 --> 01:14:43,516
- You just had to have it!
- Do you want me to drive?

709
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:44,938
- Do you want me to drive?
- Look, it's a stick.

710
01:14:44,963 --> 01:14:46,393
Look at this. 
Look how slow you're going.

711
01:14:46,418 --> 01:14:47,854
Speed it up.

712
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:54,113
Who's this guy?

713
01:14:55,766 --> 01:14:57,299
Shit!

714
01:15:16,116 --> 01:15:18,372
AWW!

715
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:26,231
Go-go-go-go.
GO!

716
01:15:28,686 --> 01:15:31,490
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm okay.

717
01:15:35,828 --> 01:15:37,343
Oh!

718
01:15:37,851 --> 01:15:40,090
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

719
01:15:47,447 --> 01:15:49,447
Here they come!

720
01:15:49,472 --> 01:15:51,371
What're we gonna do?

721
01:16:03,996 --> 01:16:05,758
Gun!

722
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:09,998
 Do you have
your seat belts on?

723
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,190
What?
You're asking me that now?

724
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,520
- Hang on!
- Ah!

725
01:16:22,497 --> 01:16:24,023
Aww!

726
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:02,522
Are you good?

727
01:17:02,547 --> 01:17:04,946
Things...
got a little out of hand.

728
01:17:04,971 --> 01:17:07,371
Aw!
Look out!

729
01:17:11,703 --> 01:17:14,580
Okay.
We're good?

730
01:17:23,032 --> 01:17:25,430
Oh, hi boys.
What did I miss?

731
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:33,141
Woo. That look sharp.
Careful, careful.

732
01:21:15,468 --> 01:21:17,645
So, what do we do now?

733
01:21:19,746 --> 01:21:23,538
Please tell me, you made
a copy of that disk.

734
01:21:25,232 --> 01:21:27,872
Of course I made a copy.

735
01:21:35,254 --> 01:21:37,079
So where are we going?

736
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,391
It's a ledger.

737
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:04,607
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

738
01:22:04,632 --> 01:22:08,424
Who they are, the politicians they control,
and where the money comes from.

739
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:10,604
It's everything you want to know.

740
01:22:10,637 --> 01:22:14,774
What makes you think this
so-called ledger is authentic?

741
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:17,414
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

742
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:19,966
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

743
01:22:19,991 --> 01:22:23,291
Did you never stop to consider
he may want me to have it?

744
01:22:23,316 --> 01:22:24,858
Misinformation, manipulation.

745
01:22:24,883 --> 01:22:27,505
It's what he does, Ilsa,
it's what he's trained to do.

746
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:30,809
Lane lies to you,
you sell his lies to Hunt.

747
01:22:30,834 --> 01:22:32,503
Together, you're both compromised.

748
01:22:32,528 --> 01:22:34,912
That's his ultimate objective.

749
01:22:34,937 --> 01:22:36,815
This may be authentic.

750
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,094
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

751
01:22:43,568 --> 01:22:45,036
No.

752
01:22:46,443 --> 01:22:49,207
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

753
01:22:49,232 --> 01:22:54,487
Your orders were to infiltrate the Syndicate
that we may learn more about them first hand.

754
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:56,781
This isn't prove, it's a test,
like everything else.

755
01:22:56,806 --> 01:22:59,336
The only way to pass,
is to go back.

756
01:22:59,361 --> 01:23:00,815
I can't do that.

757
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,546
I betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

758
01:23:03,571 --> 01:23:05,880
And in every instance, you
did so on you own volition.

759
01:23:05,905 --> 01:23:08,641
He was going to tortured
and killed an American agent.

760
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:12,155
And you should've let him, and
you would still have Lane's trust.

761
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:14,281
This is the trade,
Hunt understands that.

762
01:23:14,306 --> 01:23:16,846
I wasn't going to let him die.
He is our ally.

763
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:21,424
There are no allies in state craft,
Ilsa. Only common interest.

764
01:23:21,449 --> 01:23:25,143
As it stands, Ethan Hunt
is a man without a country.

765
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:29,876
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

766
01:23:31,038 --> 01:23:32,896
Are you ordering
me to kill Hunt?

767
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:35,928
Good god, no.
Nothing so crude as that, no.

768
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:38,811
Lane will order you.

769
01:23:38,836 --> 01:23:44,010
And to regain his trust,
you will do it.

770
01:23:44,496 --> 01:23:47,677
You sent me
to do a job.

771
01:23:47,702 --> 01:23:49,595
I did it.

772
01:23:49,832 --> 01:23:51,783
Now, you bring me in.

773
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:56,017
Might I remind you, you're
without a country of your own.

774
01:23:56,393 --> 01:23:59,584
The director of the CIA called me
inquiring about you personally.

775
01:23:59,609 --> 01:24:02,038
Of course to protect your cover,
I had to lie.

776
01:24:02,063 --> 01:24:03,541
So, as far as the
Americans are concern,

777
01:24:03,566 --> 01:24:07,415
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

778
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,740
A precious few people
know about your true identity.

779
01:24:10,765 --> 01:24:16,008
It would be unfortunate
if we forgot.

780
01:24:16,445 --> 01:24:19,470
You see, there really
is no choice ,Ilsa.

781
01:24:19,495 --> 01:24:21,626
You're going back.

782
01:24:28,844 --> 01:24:32,087
Glad to know
you're still with us.

783
01:24:40,254 --> 01:24:41,453
What?
What's happening?

784
01:24:41,454 --> 01:24:42,911
I can't open it.

785
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:44,129
What do you mean
you can't open it?

786
01:24:44,154 --> 01:24:46,399
I mean
I can't open it, ever.

787
01:24:46,424 --> 01:24:48,212
That's a red box.

788
01:24:48,237 --> 01:24:50,103
- A what?
- It's a red box.

789
01:24:50,128 --> 01:24:53,050
The British government uses it
to transport national secrets.

790
01:24:53,075 --> 01:24:54,124
Doesn't sound good.

791
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:56,645
Meaning it's triple encrypted.
You don't get into that thing

792
01:24:56,670 --> 01:25:02,124
unless you have fingerprints, retinal scan, and
a voice phrase spoken by a specific individual.

793
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:04,554
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.

794
01:25:04,579 --> 01:25:05,762
Yes, him.

795
01:25:05,787 --> 01:25:07,847
So, what you're saying is,
there is no ledger.

796
01:25:07,848 --> 01:25:10,358
which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exist.

797
01:25:10,383 --> 01:25:11,841
So, we're back to square one.

798
01:25:11,866 --> 01:25:14,431
Only now, we're all
wanted by the CIA.

799
01:25:14,456 --> 01:25:16,373
I'm so proud of us.

800
01:25:16,398 --> 01:25:21,901
What I don't understand is why is there a
red box sat in a private data vault in Morocco.

801
01:25:21,926 --> 01:25:24,255
And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?

802
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,514
If Lane wants it, you can bet
that he has a plan to open it.

803
01:25:28,787 --> 01:25:31,354
And we just
help him steal it.

804
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:36,658
He's going to take
the Prime Minister.

805
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,458
Yes, he is.

806
01:25:38,647 --> 01:25:39,838
The question is how?

807
01:25:39,863 --> 01:25:41,442
Well, we have to warn
the British government.

808
01:25:41,467 --> 01:25:43,573
- Yeah, MI6.
- No, no, Brandt.

809
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:45,194
Put down the phone.
Let's think about this.

810
01:25:45,219 --> 01:25:47,695
We have a responsibility to
warn the British government,

811
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,205
and not gamble with
the Prime Minister's life.

812
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:53,005
Ethan, just so you
can beat the guy

813
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:56,157
that's beaten you at every turn.

814
01:25:57,847 --> 01:26:00,087
Is that what
you think this is?

815
01:26:00,112 --> 01:26:01,690
Brandt?

816
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:06,396
Is that what
you think this is?

817
01:26:06,945 --> 01:26:08,241
I think right now,

818
01:26:08,266 --> 01:26:10,373
you're incapable of seeing
that there's another way.

819
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:13,901
And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.

820
01:26:13,926 --> 01:26:16,563
And if he's wrong,
then we have Vienna

821
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:17,678
all over again.

822
01:26:17,703 --> 01:26:20,435
No, you don't know him.
If he wants something to happen,

823
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:21,837
there's no preventing it.

824
01:26:21,862 --> 01:26:23,811
That's why we have to
warn the British.

825
01:26:23,836 --> 01:26:26,198
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

826
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:28,510
Are you listening to yourself?
We're going to  warn the British.

827
01:26:28,535 --> 01:26:31,116
No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him.

828
01:26:31,141 --> 01:26:33,697
Before he takes the Prime Minister.

829
01:26:38,462 --> 01:26:39,817
Okay.

830
01:26:39,842 --> 01:26:42,756
Alright, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.

831
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:44,687
But please tell me.

832
01:26:44,688 --> 01:26:46,836
How're we going to do that?

833
01:27:25,727 --> 01:27:27,394
All is forgiven.

834
01:27:27,419 --> 01:27:29,523
That isn't a ledger, is it?

835
01:27:29,548 --> 01:27:31,833
You didn't take
a look for yourself?

836
01:27:31,858 --> 01:27:33,283
Of course I did.

837
01:27:33,284 --> 01:27:35,042
But the file was encrypted.

838
01:27:35,043 --> 01:27:36,568
And why would I lie to you?

839
01:27:36,593 --> 01:27:38,889
So that I would lie to Hunt.

840
01:27:40,195 --> 01:27:43,555
But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.

841
01:27:44,277 --> 01:27:46,537
And you wouldn't have helped him.

842
01:27:48,024 --> 01:27:50,027
What is actually on that disk?

843
01:27:50,052 --> 01:27:53,662
I'll be honest with you when
you start being honest with me.

844
01:27:54,627 --> 01:27:57,171
And you and I, we both know
why you come back.

845
01:27:57,196 --> 01:27:58,947
Don't we?

846
01:28:01,291 --> 01:28:04,206
You're still alive because
I believe in your potential.

847
01:28:04,231 --> 01:28:06,738
But I'm growing impatient.

848
01:28:07,618 --> 01:28:10,795
Why do you continue to resist?

849
01:28:14,143 --> 01:28:16,171
Well, if we're being honest,

850
01:28:16,804 --> 01:28:18,257
You're a terrorist.

851
01:28:18,282 --> 01:28:22,140
If that were true then my goal
would be to spread fear, but my...

852
01:28:22,165 --> 01:28:26,166
method is...
far more surgical.

853
01:28:27,438 --> 01:28:29,414
You kill innocent people.

854
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:34,378
I helped my government killed many
innocent people and more, so much more.

855
01:28:35,147 --> 01:28:38,069
Killing to keep things as they were.

856
01:28:38,094 --> 01:28:41,693
And now I'm killing
to bring about change.

857
01:28:42,171 --> 01:28:44,860
I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.

858
01:28:44,885 --> 01:28:47,068
Ethan Hunt is a gambler.

859
01:28:47,093 --> 01:28:49,335
And one day
his luck will run out,

860
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:53,053
And thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.

861
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,857
Which one of us
will be the villain then?

862
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:02,054
Nothing here.
It's empty.

863
01:29:18,056 --> 01:29:21,778
I'm interested
to see who you blame

864
01:29:23,092 --> 01:29:25,523
for what happens next.

865
01:30:12,315 --> 01:30:13,787
So, that's her?

866
01:30:13,788 --> 01:30:15,776
That's her.

867
01:30:18,696 --> 01:30:20,424
I have to say,

868
01:30:21,596 --> 01:30:23,794
you sure can ride.

869
01:30:26,106 --> 01:30:28,664
- Ethan.
- You're just doing your job.

870
01:30:29,584 --> 01:30:32,062
That's all I'm going to
say about it.

871
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:35,121
Attlee said you'd understand.

872
01:30:35,146 --> 01:30:38,925
Attlee, your handler
in British Intelligence.

873
01:30:41,683 --> 01:30:44,007
And he didn't bring you in?

874
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:48,063
Even after you
gave him the disk?

875
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:51,199
You knew perfectly well
it was blank.

876
01:30:51,224 --> 01:30:52,425
That's a lie.

877
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:55,035
The disk she took from me was 
an exact copy, I'm sure of it.

878
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,969
Was it in your possession
the entire time?

879
01:31:02,706 --> 01:31:03,922
<font color="#e4adc0">DELETING FILES</font>

880
01:31:03,947 --> 01:31:05,511
<font color="#e4adc0">FILES DELETED</font>

881
01:31:08,098 --> 01:31:09,662
Oh.

882
01:31:09,687 --> 01:31:13,007
They don't care
if you live or die.

883
01:31:19,809 --> 01:31:22,794
But you knew I was
going to take it to him.

884
01:31:22,819 --> 01:31:24,353
I hope you would.

885
01:31:24,378 --> 01:31:27,087
I hope it would be
enough to get you out.

886
01:31:27,371 --> 01:31:28,609
Whoa-whoa-whoa. That means Lane

887
01:31:28,635 --> 01:31:30,449
doesn't have the
disk, only we do.

888
01:31:30,474 --> 01:31:33,628
I have a question.
If the disk was blank,

889
01:31:33,653 --> 01:31:35,737
why is she still alive?

890
01:31:35,762 --> 01:31:37,651
Unless, of course,

891
01:31:37,652 --> 01:31:40,111
Lane wanted us to find her.

892
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,734
So, who're you
working for now?

893
01:31:44,176 --> 01:31:48,349
Lane, Attlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same

894
01:31:48,498 --> 01:31:52,732
We only think we're fighting for the right side
because that's what we choose to believe.

895
01:31:53,856 --> 01:31:55,841
So what does that leave us?

896
01:31:55,842 --> 01:31:58,623
The way I see it,
you have 3 choices.

897
01:31:58,652 --> 01:32:02,378
One, you hand me and
the disk over to the CIA.

898
01:32:02,403 --> 01:32:04,218
I'm proof that Syndicate exist.

899
01:32:04,243 --> 01:32:07,744
Lane becomes their problem,
and... your work is done.

900
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:10,279
- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me.

901
01:32:10,304 --> 01:32:12,430
But you know they're
not going to believe you.

902
01:32:12,455 --> 01:32:15,213
And you all will be
trialed for treason.

903
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:16,715
Lane goes free.

904
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,648
I'm afraid
she's has a point.

905
01:32:18,649 --> 01:32:22,811
Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.

906
01:32:22,836 --> 01:32:26,500
You use the disk
as bait to trap Lane.

907
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:29,492
But some part of you suspect
you've met your match.

908
01:32:29,517 --> 01:32:32,211
And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk

909
01:32:32,236 --> 01:32:34,520
whether you want to or not.

910
01:32:34,545 --> 01:32:36,961
That is entirely possible.

911
01:32:36,986 --> 01:32:38,817
And option three?

912
01:32:39,108 --> 01:32:41,056
Come away with me.

913
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:43,834
Right now.

914
01:32:46,613 --> 01:32:49,110
Oh boy.

915
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:53,898
And what about Lane?

916
01:32:53,899 --> 01:32:56,049
Forget about Lane.

917
01:32:56,074 --> 01:32:58,537
There will always be another Lane.

918
01:32:58,562 --> 01:33:01,834
There will always be
people like us to face him.

919
01:33:02,297 --> 01:33:05,817
We've done our part
and we've been cast aside.

920
01:33:06,308 --> 01:33:08,916
We can be anyone.

921
01:33:08,941 --> 01:33:11,511
We can do anything.

922
01:33:12,862 --> 01:33:15,355
It's only a matter of going.

923
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:31,498
Lane sent you to deliver
a message, didn't he?

924
01:33:31,854 --> 01:33:34,801
I saved you life twice.
I won't be able to do it again.

925
01:33:34,826 --> 01:33:36,872
What's the message?

926
01:33:49,419 --> 01:33:51,145
Benji.

927
01:34:03,187 --> 01:34:04,662
Parking garage

928
01:34:04,687 --> 01:34:06,841
Luther, stay with her.

929
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:31,927
She's gone.

930
01:34:31,952 --> 01:34:33,786
I lost her.

931
01:34:36,472 --> 01:34:38,851
She set us up, Ethan.

932
01:34:38,876 --> 01:34:40,738
No, she delivered a message.

933
01:34:40,763 --> 01:34:42,365
She set us up!

934
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:43,641
She knew this would happen.

935
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:47,522
Only Lane knows
what's going to happen.

936
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:54,336
I have a job for you, Ethan.

937
01:34:54,361 --> 01:34:57,118
And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it.

938
01:34:57,143 --> 01:34:58,277
I'm listening.

939
01:34:58,302 --> 01:35:01,226
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

940
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:04,858
Is to bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight today.

941
01:35:04,883 --> 01:35:07,504
Now say the words, please.

942
01:35:07,956 --> 01:35:09,921
I accept.

943
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:12,004
Yes.

944
01:35:14,539 --> 01:35:16,456
I knew you would.

945
01:35:23,177 --> 01:35:28,229
He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight

946
01:35:28,254 --> 01:35:33,771
Ethan, there's only one person
on earth who can unlock that disk.

947
01:35:34,031 --> 01:35:36,562
We have to take
the Prime Minister.

948
01:35:37,362 --> 01:35:40,292
Let's just think about
that for a minute.

949
01:35:41,287 --> 01:35:43,556
That's the only way
to get Benji back.

950
01:35:43,581 --> 01:35:47,099
Ethan, that's exactly what
Lane wants you to do.

951
01:35:47,124 --> 01:35:50,615
Which is why
it has to happen.

952
01:35:54,644 --> 01:35:56,798
This is how we beat Lane.

953
01:35:57,521 --> 01:35:59,698
This is how we make
everything right.

954
01:35:59,723 --> 01:36:03,892
Can you see?
Can you see it?

955
01:36:17,278 --> 01:36:21,207
William Brandt, sir.
He says it's urgent.

956
01:36:25,785 --> 01:36:27,861
I had a feeling you'd come
to your senses, Brandt.

957
01:36:27,892 --> 01:36:30,394
I'm only calling you because
I've no other choice.

958
01:36:30,419 --> 01:36:32,118
I'm trying to prevent
a catastrophe.

959
01:36:32,143 --> 01:36:34,967
I can understand that.
Where are you?

960
01:36:36,361 --> 01:36:39,847
- London
- Reroute us to London, now.

961
01:36:39,872 --> 01:36:42,612
- Where in London?
- I'll tell you when you land, not before.

962
01:36:42,637 --> 01:36:44,601
I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt.

963
01:36:44,626 --> 01:36:47,730
And I'm not interested in seeing
my friends get killed either.

964
01:36:47,755 --> 01:36:50,276
So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going to do this in my terms

965
01:36:50,301 --> 01:36:52,244
and my terms only.
Do you understand?

966
01:36:52,269 --> 01:36:55,002
Keep your phone on,
instruction will follow.

967
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:04,500
- Should have been gone by now.
- Yeah.

968
01:37:06,887 --> 01:37:09,354
- You okay?
- Yeah.

969
01:37:11,611 --> 01:37:15,671
We're suppose to take down the
Prime Minister of Great Britain tonight.

970
01:37:16,273 --> 01:37:18,005
So...

971
01:37:19,177 --> 01:37:20,792
Brandt.

972
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:26,662
I cant' see another way.

973
01:37:28,675 --> 01:37:30,504
Neither can I.

974
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:35,748
What we do, we have to do
for our friends, right?

975
01:38:20,484 --> 01:38:22,626
Get him ready, please.

976
01:38:47,528 --> 01:38:49,567
You're right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?

977
01:38:49,592 --> 01:38:51,540
He's on his way.
We don't have much time.

978
01:38:51,565 --> 01:38:54,312
- What does he intend to do?
- What matter is he's alive.

979
01:38:54,337 --> 01:38:58,389
And I need your reassurance
that it's going to stay that way.

980
01:39:13,506 --> 01:39:16,855
Have you informed the British Government
that Hunt has targeted the Prime Minister?

981
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:21,884
I will help you capture him... alive.
That is the deal.

982
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:30,263
You picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt

983
01:39:30,288 --> 01:39:34,617
The worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome.

984
01:39:34,642 --> 01:39:36,405
Stay with him.

985
01:39:40,156 --> 01:39:42,458
Chief Attlee.
Chief Attlee.

986
01:39:42,483 --> 01:39:44,841
Director Hunley, how
delightful to see you here.

987
01:39:44,866 --> 01:39:48,803
Last time we spoke, you were
hunting rogue agents in Morocco.

988
01:39:48,828 --> 01:39:53,209
Chief Attlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger.

989
01:39:55,912 --> 01:39:57,735
I'm listening.

990
01:40:00,502 --> 01:40:04,366
Any advance on 22,000?
Anyone?

991
01:40:04,391 --> 01:40:07,096
Going once.
Going twice.

992
01:40:07,121 --> 01:40:09,880
Sold!
To our generous Chairwoman.

993
01:40:09,905 --> 01:40:13,028
Sir. Chief Attlee from
MI6 needs to see you.

994
01:40:13,053 --> 01:40:14,963
He says it's urgent.

995
01:40:15,962 --> 01:40:17,924
Excuse me.

996
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:32,332
- What's this all about?
- It's a matter of national security, Sir.

997
01:40:39,112 --> 01:40:43,592
- Under no circumstances is anyone to enter.
- Yes sir.

998
01:40:45,042 --> 01:40:47,374
Help me to understand.

999
01:40:47,399 --> 01:40:50,160
Who is this man?
Why is he after me?

1000
01:40:50,185 --> 01:40:55,275
I'm afraid, Prime Minister, Director Hunley
and I share responsibility for this.

1001
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:59,735
Ethan Hunt was part of a disgrace intelligence
agency which is since been dissolved.

1002
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,466
And he's gone rogue,
unfortunately intend on

1003
01:41:02,491 --> 01:41:05,009
dismantling an imaginary terror network.

1004
01:41:05,034 --> 01:41:06,744
But new intelligence
suggest that he's been

1005
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:09,297
manipulated by one of
your own former agents.

1006
01:41:09,322 --> 01:41:12,314
Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared 2 years ago.

1007
01:41:12,339 --> 01:41:13,967
And if you don't mind I asking,

1008
01:41:13,992 --> 01:41:16,429
what do I have to do with
this phantom network?

1009
01:41:16,454 --> 01:41:19,385
Sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.

1010
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:22,695
He came forward with first hand
knowledge of the plot against you.

1011
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:27,304
Sir. Hunt is in possession of a virtual
red box that can only be open by you.

1012
01:41:27,329 --> 01:41:31,248
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

1013
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:37,572
- The Syndicate, you say?
- Yes, Sir. That's what he calls it.

1014
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,024
Attlee.

1015
01:41:40,049 --> 01:41:45,027
He couldn't possibly be talking
about that "Syndicate"?

1016
01:41:46,786 --> 01:41:50,853
'Cause you assured me that,
that "Syndicate" was merely an exercise?

1017
01:41:50,878 --> 01:41:54,264
And it was, Prime Minister.
I can assure you.

1018
01:41:54,289 --> 01:41:57,461
And yet, here we have the Central
Intelligence Agency indicating otherwise.

1019
01:41:57,486 --> 01:42:01,184
- I don't understand.
- Prime Minister, your life is in danger.

1020
01:42:01,209 --> 01:42:04,196
I think our first priority is to
move you to a secure location.

1021
01:42:04,221 --> 01:42:08,539
Sir.  Does the name, 
Solomon Lane, ring a bell?

1022
01:42:09,699 --> 01:42:16,137
Yes.
Unfortunately, it does.

1023
01:42:17,604 --> 01:42:20,566
So, there actually is
a Syndicate?

1024
01:42:20,591 --> 01:42:24,745
It was a hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Attlee.

1025
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:29,091
Recruit former agents from other nations.
supply them with a new identity

1026
01:42:29,116 --> 01:42:33,642
and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.

1027
01:42:33,667 --> 01:42:39,575
It's operating budget was to be hidden offshore
in a virtual red box which I alone would control

1028
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,729
It would've made me judge, jury and
executioner with zero accountability.

1029
01:42:43,754 --> 01:42:46,313
I rejected the proposal unequivocally.

1030
01:42:46,338 --> 01:42:50,932
Furthermore, I was given every assurance
it never pass the planning stage.

1031
01:42:50,956 --> 01:42:53,887
Prime Minister,
there is no any Syndicate.

1032
01:42:53,912 --> 01:42:56,339
These people have been
duped by agent Faust.

1033
01:42:56,364 --> 01:42:59,931
Attlee.
Save it for the public inquiry.

1034
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:01,431
Sir, I urge you not to
leave this room.

1035
01:43:01,456 --> 01:43:03,323
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1036
01:43:03,348 --> 01:43:05,822
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

1037
01:43:05,847 --> 01:43:09,092
A specialist without equal,
immune to any counter measures.

1038
01:43:09,117 --> 01:43:13,278
There is no secret he cannot extract.
No security he cannot breach.

1039
01:43:13,303 --> 01:43:15,838
No person he cannot become.

1040
01:43:15,863 --> 01:43:19,179
He has mostly likely anticipated
this very conversation

1041
01:43:19,204 --> 01:43:22,376
and is waiting to strike in
whatever direction we move.

1042
01:43:22,401 --> 01:43:26,541
Sir. Hunt is the living
manifestation of destiny.

1043
01:43:26,566 --> 01:43:30,502
And he has made you
his mission.

1044
01:43:30,852 --> 01:43:32,726
Prime Minister.

1045
01:43:48,684 --> 01:43:50,222
Hunt.

1046
01:43:50,247 --> 01:43:53,244
Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister.

1047
01:43:56,317 --> 01:43:58,559
Just relax, Sir.
Everything is going to be alright.

1048
01:43:58,584 --> 01:44:02,191
- Attlee shot me
- Yes, he did, Sir.

1049
01:44:05,077 --> 01:44:10,753
Hunt, I hope you realize you set back
US, UK relations to the American revolution.

1050
01:44:10,778 --> 01:44:14,514
Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir.

1051
01:44:16,511 --> 01:44:18,337
- I'm here.
- Standby to receive.

1052
01:44:18,362 --> 01:44:19,989
Ready.

1053
01:44:25,697 --> 01:44:28,286
The Prime Minister's office
ask me to meet him here.

1054
01:44:28,311 --> 01:44:29,785
This way, sir

1055
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:31,581
Scanning.

1056
01:44:34,887 --> 01:44:37,154
Retinal scan, confirm.

1057
01:44:39,961 --> 01:44:42,159
Some convenience, Sir.

1058
01:44:42,901 --> 01:44:45,738
You got a very warm hand.

1059
01:44:54,499 --> 01:44:56,936
Biometric, confirm.

1060
01:44:56,961 --> 01:45:00,354
- The prompt is "KIPLING".
- The prompt is "KIPLING".

1061
01:45:00,999 --> 01:45:05,105
Sir, I'm gonna need a pass phrase,
the prompt is "KIPLING".

1062
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:06,720
Yes, of course.

1063
01:45:06,745 --> 01:45:11,146
" If you can keep your head when 
all about you. Are losing theirs..."

1064
01:45:15,402 --> 01:45:19,661
"If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you"

1065
01:45:23,488 --> 01:45:25,391
- You got it?
- I got it.

1066
01:45:25,416 --> 01:45:26,988
Oh man, do I got it.

1067
01:45:27,013 --> 01:45:31,285
- I'm here to see the Prime Minister.
- We were told not to let anybody in.

1068
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:34,682
- By whom?
- By you, sir.

1069
01:45:37,859 --> 01:45:41,920
Hunley, what is this?
Security!

1070
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:52,136
Chief Attlee. Kind of you
to accepted our invitation.

1071
01:45:52,275 --> 01:45:53,579
Ah.

1072
01:46:01,276 --> 01:46:04,133
Do you know who I am?

1073
01:46:05,617 --> 01:46:07,715
We know you
created the Syndicate.

1074
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:10,571
But Lane went rogue and
turn it against you, didn't he?

1075
01:46:10,596 --> 01:46:13,059
And you've been desperately
trying to cover it up.

1076
01:46:13,084 --> 01:46:15,926
That's why you erased the disk
which she brought it to you.

1077
01:46:15,951 --> 01:46:18,369
That's true.

1078
01:46:20,398 --> 01:46:24,948
Now, Director Hunley has some questions
for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

1079
01:46:24,973 --> 01:46:27,441
Namely, how you frame her.

1080
01:46:27,466 --> 01:46:31,397
That's also true.

1081
01:46:34,806 --> 01:46:36,256
It's the antidote.

1082
01:46:36,281 --> 01:46:38,940
When the Prime Minister found
out about the Syndicate.

1083
01:46:38,965 --> 01:46:41,914
- Attlee had attacked him.
- Yes, that's true.

1084
01:46:41,939 --> 01:46:44,651
And then you saved the
Prime Minister, sir.

1085
01:46:44,676 --> 01:46:46,431
Did he?

1086
01:46:46,547 --> 01:46:48,661
I'm very grateful.

1087
01:46:59,185 --> 01:47:00,638
Sir.

1088
01:47:02,926 --> 01:47:06,405
You're cutting it very close, Ethan

1089
01:47:07,096 --> 01:47:10,233
I have what you want.
Where do I go?

1090
01:47:26,961 --> 01:47:28,807
Ethan, wait

1091
01:47:28,934 --> 01:47:31,229
If I'm not there in
15 minutes, he'll kill Benji.

1092
01:47:31,254 --> 01:47:33,100
The mission is to bring
down the Syndicate.

1093
01:47:33,125 --> 01:47:37,395
If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower.

1094
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:40,266
He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it.

1095
01:47:40,291 --> 01:47:43,644
What happens, Ethan,
if you can't make it back?

1096
01:47:43,894 --> 01:47:46,042
I'll make it back.

1097
01:47:46,896 --> 01:47:48,626
Just be ready.

1098
01:47:53,173 --> 01:47:56,156
Greetings, Prime Minister.
If you are viewing this message,

1099
01:47:56,181 --> 01:47:59,068
it means that you have chosen
to activate the Syndicate.

1100
01:47:59,092 --> 01:48:04,455
This drive gives you access to 2.4 billion
pound sterling in untraceable currency.

1101
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:09,331
That will allow the Syndicate
to operate undetected for decades.

1102
01:48:09,356 --> 01:48:14,802
Instructions to access
these funds are as follows.

1103
01:49:20,489 --> 01:49:23,431
This is the end, Mr. Hunt.

1104
01:49:32,118 --> 01:49:33,783
Carefully.

1105
01:49:36,495 --> 01:49:42,316
2 pounds of Semtex,
500, 30 caliber ball bearings.

1106
01:49:42,341 --> 01:49:46,065
Your friend is sitting on a
highly sensitive - pressure trigger.

1107
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:48,711
So, no sudden moves.

1108
01:49:56,449 --> 01:49:57,770
Your final test.

1109
01:49:57,795 --> 01:50:02,326
When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji.

1110
01:50:02,548 --> 01:50:06,876
If not,
everyone dies.

1111
01:50:09,078 --> 01:50:13,321
No time to think, Ethan.
Have a seat, please.

1112
01:50:27,644 --> 01:50:31,411
Human nature,
my weapon of choice.

1113
01:50:31,436 --> 01:50:35,111
From the moment I killed the
young lady in the record shop,

1114
01:50:35,136 --> 01:50:38,539
I knew you would stop
at nothing to catch me.

1115
01:50:38,752 --> 01:50:41,430
I also knew Ilsa
wouldn't have a choice.

1116
01:50:41,455 --> 01:50:45,183
Whether she broke you that night
you met or let you go.

1117
01:50:45,208 --> 01:50:50,571
Whether you let her run in Morocco.
Whether she went to Attlee or not.

1118
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:55,220
You were certain we would
end up where we are... right now.

1119
01:50:58,569 --> 01:51:00,390
Then again.

1120
01:51:01,391 --> 01:51:03,448
So was I.

1121
01:51:03,937 --> 01:51:05,162
I know you, Lane.

1122
01:51:05,187 --> 01:51:08,193
Somewhere along the line
you had a crisis of faith.

1123
01:51:08,218 --> 01:51:12,091
Human life didn't matter anymore,
or maybe it never really did.

1124
01:51:12,116 --> 01:51:18,263
Either way, you killed too many innocent people
without ever asking who is giving the orders.

1125
01:51:18,288 --> 01:51:19,660
Or why.

1126
01:51:19,685 --> 01:51:21,873
You blame the system
for what you are.

1127
01:51:21,898 --> 01:51:24,248
Instead of yourself.

1128
01:51:24,273 --> 01:51:26,275
You wanted revenge.

1129
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,259
But Rome wasn't
destroyed in a day.

1130
01:51:28,284 --> 01:51:32,118
You needed help, you
needed the money. A lot of it.

1131
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:35,364
And you'll stop at
nothing to get it.

1132
01:51:35,389 --> 01:51:39,328
That's how I know I'm going
to put you in a box.

1133
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:44,858
- Where is the disk?
- Where is the disk?

1134
01:51:44,883 --> 01:51:48,758
You like to play games.
I've a game for you.

1135
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:53,552
I'll give you
50 million dollars

1136
01:51:54,172 --> 01:51:56,418
to let Benji go.

1137
01:52:12,505 --> 01:52:17,369
- Where is the disk?
- Where is the disk?

1138
01:52:17,394 --> 01:52:20,325
You're looking at it.
I am the disk.

1139
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:23,971
I memorized it all 2.4 billion
in number accounts.

1140
01:52:23,996 --> 01:52:27,576
If that vest goes off, you get nothing.
Without this money, you are nothing.

1141
01:52:27,601 --> 01:52:31,103
Without me, 
you are nothing.

1142
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:39,415
Right now, you're thinking it's bluff.
I'd never let my friends die.

1143
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:42,719
I couldn't possibly
memorize the entire disk.

1144
01:52:42,744 --> 01:52:45,034
There's only one way
to be sure.

1145
01:52:46,161 --> 01:52:47,937
Let Benji go

1146
01:53:05,485 --> 01:53:07,221
Take him.

1147
01:53:10,589 --> 01:53:13,365
They come 1 step closer,
shoot me.

1148
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:16,302
Stop.

1149
01:53:19,387 --> 01:53:22,341
You remember I told you, one day
you were going to take things too far?

1150
01:53:22,366 --> 01:53:24,194
This is me speaking, by the way.
It's not him.

1151
01:53:24,219 --> 01:53:29,156
The only way this ends is
you and me, Lane, face to face.

1152
01:53:29,181 --> 01:53:32,188
Only this time I won't
be locked in a glass box.

1153
01:53:32,213 --> 01:53:33,530
You want your money.

1154
01:53:33,555 --> 01:53:36,968
The bone doctor is going to 
beat it out of me.

1155
01:53:36,993 --> 01:53:40,132
Now let Benji go

1156
01:53:44,561 --> 01:53:47,269
1... 3... 9...

1157
01:54:07,738 --> 01:54:09,040
Go.

1158
01:54:09,065 --> 01:54:11,933
- Ethan.
- Brandt and Luther are waiting. Go.

1159
01:54:20,034 --> 01:54:23,081
- What do I do?
- Kill the woman.

1160
01:54:24,286 --> 01:54:26,444
I need Hunt alive.

1161
01:55:13,658 --> 01:55:15,491
- Go!
- It's Benji, where am I going?

1162
01:55:15,516 --> 01:55:17,236
- They're coming.
- We're not ready.

1163
01:55:17,261 --> 01:55:19,145
Then get ready.

1164
01:55:45,005 --> 01:55:46,564
Which way?

1165
02:00:06,431 --> 02:00:10,844
Face to face.
Just as you wish, Ethan

1166
02:00:33,357 --> 02:00:35,564
It hurts, I know.

1167
02:00:37,205 --> 02:00:40,627
Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.

1168
02:00:41,152 --> 02:00:42,988
Mr. Lane.

1169
02:00:44,147 --> 02:00:46,564
Meet the IMF.

1170
02:02:05,577 --> 02:02:07,675
You're free now.

1171
02:02:09,918 --> 02:02:11,875
Where will you go?

1172
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:14,821
I don't know.

1173
02:02:16,879 --> 02:02:18,993
I've done my part.

1174
02:02:19,323 --> 02:02:20,846
Yeah.

1175
02:02:25,957 --> 02:02:28,180
Ethan, we got to go.

1176
02:02:37,069 --> 02:02:39,183
You better hurry now.

1177
02:02:41,112 --> 02:02:42,856
Good luck.

1178
02:02:57,482 --> 02:02:59,767
You know how to find me.

1179
02:03:16,885 --> 02:03:18,792
Director Hunley.

1180
02:03:20,361 --> 02:03:23,444
- Director Hunley .
- Ah... Mr. Chairman.

1181
02:03:23,469 --> 02:03:28,364
6 months ago, you stood before this panel
and demanded that the IMF be dissolved.

1182
02:03:28,389 --> 02:03:30,029
That is correct, sir.

1183
02:03:30,054 --> 02:03:32,073
And how do you explain
your testimony today?

1184
02:03:32,098 --> 02:03:34,329
It's quite simple really.
We had reason to believe

1185
02:03:34,354 --> 02:03:37,882
that the Syndicate have infiltrated
our government at the highest level.

1186
02:03:37,907 --> 02:03:43,452
In order for our men to infiltrate that
organization, his cover had to be absolute.

1187
02:03:43,477 --> 02:03:47,908
The whole operation was known only
to myself and a handful of IMF agents.

1188
02:03:47,933 --> 02:03:52,935
So, the shuttering of the IMF was
all part of an elaborate scheme.

1189
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:56,312
- To expose this so call Syndicate?
- That is correct, sir.

1190
02:03:56,337 --> 02:04:01,878
Which is why you're here today,
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

1191
02:04:01,903 --> 02:04:04,086
That is correct, sir.

1192
02:04:06,098 --> 02:04:09,667
I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.

1193
02:04:09,692 --> 02:04:14,150
Desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.

1194
02:04:14,998 --> 02:04:16,834
And you, Mr. Brandt.

1195
02:04:16,859 --> 02:04:19,902
How can you justify
this deception?

1196
02:04:21,171 --> 02:04:24,566
I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation

1197
02:04:24,591 --> 02:04:27,029
without the Secretary's approval.

1198
02:04:34,660 --> 02:04:36,737
Welcome to the IMF.

1199
02:04:37,109 --> 02:04:39,119
Mr. Secretary.
