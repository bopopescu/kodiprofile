BIRD CAWS

BIRD CAWS

4
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,950
He's a magician.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,140
No, he smells too nice.

6
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
BIRD CAWS

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,400
Morning.

HORSE NEIGHS

9
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,230
Your book, sir.

10
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,220
I'm obliged to you.

11
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,790
'Some years ago, there
was, in the city of York,

12
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,230
'a society of magicians.

13
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,030
'They met up on the third Wednesday
of every month and read

14
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,430
'each other long, dull papers upon

15
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,870
'the history of English magic.

16
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,230
'They were gentlemen
magicians, which is

17
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,350
'to say they had never
harmed anyone by magic.

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,910
'Nor ever done anyone
the slightest good.

19
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,310
'In fact, to own the truth,

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,030
'not one of these magicians had
ever cast the smallest spell.

21
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,550
'Nor, by magic, caused one leaf to
tremble upon a tree, made one mote

22
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,510
'of dust alter its course
or changed a single

23
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,470
'hair upon anyone's head.

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,750
'With this one minor reservation,

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,230
'they enjoyed a reputation as some

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,310
'of the wisest and
most magical gentlemen

27
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,070
'in Yorkshire.'

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,390
Mr...

29
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,550
Mr Segundus!

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,230
~ Yes.
~ HE COUGHS

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,550
Excuse me. Er...

32
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,430
ha...

33
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,550
It has been no small inducement,

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,630
in my coming to York,

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,110
that your excellent and, er,
distinguished society exists here.

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,470
~ Er, not to mention your extensive
library of magical books.
~ That's right.

37
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,510
Er, I have studied magic,
gentlemen, for many years.

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,430
The histories of the Raven King,

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,190
the great magicians of long ago.

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,950
I've read the new publications

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,950
and even made my small

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,150
contribution to their number.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,480
~ HE COUGHS
~ Excuse me.

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,230
But I... but I have recently
begun to wonder why the great

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,590
feats of magic that I read about

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,470
remain in the pages of my books...

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,150
and are not seen on the street or...

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,070
on the battlefield.

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,750
I have begun to wonder why modern
magicians are unable to work

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,070
the magic that they write about.

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,990
In short, gentlemen,
I wish to know...

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,590
.. why is magic no longer
done in England.

53
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,950
THEY ALL MUTTER

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,030
It is a long question, Mr...

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,480
Segundus.

56
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,110
Magicians study magic,

57
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,750
the history of magic.
We do not perform it.

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,470
You don't expect an astronomer
to create stars, eh?

59
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,590
THEY ALL CHUCKLE

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,870
Or a botanist to invent
new flowers, eh?

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,310
~ THEY ALL LAUGH
~ It is a child's question, I
appreciate, but no-one else...

62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,590
Classical magic, sir, is not a thing
for the gentlemen of this society.

63
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,230
Nor any...

64
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,430
gentleman.

65
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,990
I do hope that you have not been

66
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,830
trying to cast spells, sir.

67
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,680
THEY ALL LAUGH

68
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,470
You told me certainly that there
would be books coming in.

69
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,790
You took a guinea from me.

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Good day to you, sir.

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,230
Mr Segundus, I say.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,190
Honeyfoot. I was there at the
society last night. May I?

73
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,270
I have made myself disagreeable.

74
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,070
No, sir. I think you hit
upon it quite correct.

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,190
Why is magic no longer done?

76
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,030
I cannot find it answered anywhere.

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,910
Can you believe there are
no books of magic to be had?

78
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,670
In York!

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,750
~ Books about magic are rare enough.
~ Books of magic.

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,990
Oh, my dear fellow, they're
more precious than rubies.

81
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,230
Even the society only
has a few pages.

82
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,870
I have tried everywhere else.

83
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,630
The society is my last
throw of the dice. Sir!

84
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,590
We're growing stale,
we need fresh opinions.

85
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,230
Oh, I'm... I'm afraid that those
books have been sold, sir.

86
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,310
I reserved them!

87
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,110
Yes, I am sorry for it, sir.

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,230
Oh, it is no matter.

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,950
Do you have anything upon the nature
of clouds, rain, atmospheres?

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,550
Yes, sir. Yes, I do,
as a matter of fact.

91
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,110
Oh, that's interesting. I'm most
fascinated by clouds myself.

92
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,630
Keep an eye open.

93
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
Mr Segundus.

94
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,760
At least I can find the devil
who keeps swiping my books.

95
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,470
Ah.

96
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,950
There.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
Norrell.

98
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,110
Hurtfew Abbey.

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,550
It is not an age for magic.

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
Why then do you persist, sir?

101
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,350
What is it?

102
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,340
Tremendously dirty.

103
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,870
From a street magician in London.

104
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,470
"A spell to join together articles

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,630
"which have been parted."

106
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,470
~ Does it work?
~ No.

107
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,710
He was a vagabond, you see.

108
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,870
Yellow curtain sort of fellow.

109
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,000
Persuaded me to part with a rather
large sum of money for that.

110
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,190
And then he called me back, said
he'd tell me a secret for nothing.

111
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,430
Told me that one day magic would
be restored to England by

112
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,190
two magicians.

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,310
Old prophecies are nonsense.

114
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,910
I know.

115
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,430
But it set me upon my present path.

116
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,870
We are two magicians. John
Segundus and Mr Honeyfoot.

117
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,990
Sounds well.

118
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,990
One would expect him to pretend
that I was one of the two,

119
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,200
but in the end he told me, rather
plainly, that I was not.

120
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,300
Mr Norrell?

121
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,160
Come in.

122
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,910
Watch your step,
gentlemen. The way is...

123
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,640
convoluted.

124
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,750
HE COUGHS

125
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,470
It's Mr Honeyfoot and Mr Segundus
of the York Society of Magicians.

126
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,920
I read your account of the careers
of Martin Pale's fairy servants, sir.

127
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,230
It's a creditable piece of work.

128
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,710
Well...

129
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,590
there was Master
Fallowthought, was there not?

130
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,440
You left him out.

131
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,030
A minor spirit, but nevertheless...

132
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,150
Fallowthought?

133
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,670
I have never even heard of him.

134
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,270
Forgive me, sir, but what a library!

135
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,830
Yes, I forget. Of course,
he is described in

136
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,510
Holgarth and Pickles' history of their
own dealings with Master Fallowthought,

137
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,190
which you can scarcely have read.

138
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,950
You have that book?

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,800
May we, may we be permitted to...

140
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,070
Nothing would be more
agreeable to me.

141
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,710
How To Putte Questions To The
Dark And Understand Its Answers.

142
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,110
It's a foolish work.

143
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,630
This is Belasis's instructions.

144
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,150
Every copy of this was
destroyed centuries ago.

145
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,390
I did devote a great deal of time to
Belasis in my youth, but no longer.

146
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,590
He is mystical when he
should be clear and clear

147
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,910
when he should be mystical.

148
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,550
These are all... books of magic.

149
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,470
Mr Norrell, such...

150
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,790
~ Surely you will find your answer here.
~ Answer?

151
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,230
To a simple question, sir.

152
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,870
In the past, magic was done
as a matter of course.

153
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,510
It... it was as much a part
of this country as the rain.

154
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,150
Then 300 years ago it died,
seemingly overnight.

155
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,470
We wish to know...

156
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,680
why magic has fallen from
its once great state.

157
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,360
We wish to know why is there
no more magic done in England?

158
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,380
It is a wrong question, sir.

159
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,750
Magic is not ended in England.

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,710
I myself am quite a tolerable,

161
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,510
practical...

162
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,960
magician.

163
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,270
Well done.

164
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,350
Well... it is done.

165
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,270
Show these gentlemen
out, Childermass.

166
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,150
~ LAUGHTER
~ Absolute tripe!

167
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,870
Oh, I'm so sorry, sirs,

168
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,270
to see you bringing magic

169
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,830
into such disrepute.

170
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,470
This Norrell is lying.

171
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,550
I disa... I disagree,
I believe Mr Norrell.

172
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,510
Did you see magic
done or did you not?

173
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,430
THEY ALL STIR

174
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,510
Gentlemen, the answer
is a simple one, eh?

175
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,150
We shall invite Mr Norrell to
prove his ridiculous assertion.

176
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,590
To do magic for us.

177
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,270
And if he cannot, or will not,

178
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,270
to lay off disturbing
our peace of mind!

179
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,520
THEY ALL CHEER

180
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,870
This is the hour and place he
appointed, and he doesn't come.

181
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,950
Mr Norrell concedes defeat.

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,720
Not at all.

183
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,600
Who are you, sir?

184
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,510
A word or two before you go in.

185
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,110
If Mr Norrell fails to do
the magic he has promised,

186
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,350
he will publicly withdraw his claim
to be a practical magician,

187
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,910
~ indeed a magician of any sort.
~ That's quite right.

188
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,260
And swears never to make
any such claim again.

189
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,950
~ Here's his hand on it.
~ I'm sure he needn't go so far.

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,470
We have no desire to punish him.

191
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,630
However, my master only thinks
it's fair to extract the same

192
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,950
promise from each of you...

193
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
.. should he succeed.

194
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,350
Here's the paper and there's
the stuff to sign your name.

195
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,550
Well, I do not believe
he can do magic,

196
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,040
and so...

197
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,030
I will sign because I believe he can.

198
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,110
And I hope he achieves recognition

199
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,240
and will use his powers for the good
of the nation in this time of war.

200
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,280
Sir.

201
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,950
I will not sign. Magic
is my life, sir.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What shall I do when
it is taken from me?

203
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,830
We shall say Mr Norrell's
contract is with all

204
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,080
members of the society...

205
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,310
.. except Mr Segundus.

206
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,240
BELL CHIMES

207
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,520
HE CHUCKLES

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,400
RUMBLING

209
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,840
WIND BLOWS

210
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,470
WHISPERING: 'Come here. Come here.

211
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,120
'Come here.'

212
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,310
~ WHISPERING:
~ 'We saw him.
~ Tyranny. Tyranny.

213
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,190
~ 'He murdered her.
~ He murdered her.

214
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,470
~ 'We know. We know. We saw him.
~ We saw it.

215
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,430
'There was no-one to
see but the stones.

216
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,830
~ 'No-one saw but the stones.
~ The stones, the stones.

217
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,070
'He murdered her! And no-one saw!'

218
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,230
The statues.

219
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,710
'The stones. Dig up his bones!

220
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,910
'Let him be punished
for his wickedness!'

221
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,230
He has brought them alive.

222
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,640
SCREAMING

223
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,800
SCREAMING

224
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,790
Ooh!

225
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,080
Oh!

226
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,120
~ STATUES: Usurper.
~ Usurper? How dare you?!

227
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,910
~ Lady Catherine. Catherine of Winchester.
~ You killed my horse, sir!

228
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,910
Oh, forever upon that damned horse!

229
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Get you gone, father.

230
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,840
My boot is on the wrong foot
and it is paining my bunion.

231
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,720
STATUES SING AND PLAY

232
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,310
HE SPEAKS IN LATIN

233
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,110
I don't know what you're
talking about.

234
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,470
HE SPEAKS IN LATIN

235
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,080
I don't know! HE SPEAKS IN LATIN

236
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,500
We have not seen the likes
of that for three centuries!

237
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,590
I am sorry for it, sirs.

238
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,510
Do not be.

239
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,710
Magic is restored to England.

240
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,390
I hope it can do some good.

241
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,790
Do you think Mr Norrell
would be offended

242
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,790
if I wrote to the London
newspapers of this?

243
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,310
I very much think he would be.

244
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,550
But I rather think my master has
hidden his talent long enough.

245
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,990
It is time for him to take his place.

246
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,470
And London is where I shall take him.

247
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,710
Well, if that is how the
first magician behaves,

248
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,060
I dare not think what
the second will be like.

249
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,230
'The Lord be with you.'

250
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,880
Let us pray.

251
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,760
In the desolate plateau of
the Iberian peninsula...

252
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,630
.. and on the battlefields of
France and the low countries.

253
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,990
Lord, we beseech your help in
these times for our country.

254
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,240
Fighting a Godless enemy.

255
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,120
Lord, we ask for courage, wisdom.

256
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,870
For the support of your
grace and the endurance

257
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,860
of your providence.

258
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,990
Which daily strengthens us. Amen.

259
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,630
ALL: Amen.

260
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,070
'Well done, Henry.'

261
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,350
You're using your voice much
better, more authority.

262
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,070
Yes, I... I think you have
definitely improved.

263
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,030
Especially the, er, the voice.

264
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,870
Thank you, Jonathan.

265
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,030
We'd saved a place for you.

266
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,990
Oh, I did not see.

267
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,950
I was at the back.

268
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,830
Yes. Right at the back.

269
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,870
Enjoying your Sunday, Mr Atkinson?

270
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,310
I... I've done everything
you want in the way of...

271
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,950
I hardly play cards.

272
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,550
I drink very, very little, scarcely
more than a bottle a day.

273
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,590
And, well...

274
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,790
I've no objection to going
to church more often.

275
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,470
Twice a week if you'd like it better.

276
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,620
I leave such matters
to your own conscience.

277
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,830
I do not know, perhaps you don't
like my going to Bath or Brighton

278
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,910
or...

279
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,910
But really, the ladies there, you
have nothing to fear from them.

280
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,070
They are without doubt
very charming, but...

281
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,350
That hadn't even occurred to me.

282
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,540
Oh.

283
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,590
~ Arabella.
~ Jonathan.

284
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,270
I only wish that you would...

285
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,920
find a way to occupy your time.

286
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,040
No-one loves a holiday better than
I, but perpetual holidays...

287
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,070
~ Does it make you happy?
~ You make me happy.

288
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,870
~ A man needs an occupation, Jonathan.
~ Arabella, you know perfectly
well that my father...

289
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,830
~ I'm going away.
~ What?

290
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,870
With Henry, to his new
parish. Help him settle.

291
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,060
Oh.

292
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,310
I'd not thought to do this
now, but I see I must act.

293
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,150
Jonathan?

294
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,870
Do not act.

295
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,190
Think.

296
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,800
I'll not be gone forever.

297
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,470
'It is cruel, sir,'

298
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,390
for a fellow of my age to be
kept from taking up any useful

299
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,630
position in the world.

300
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,030
It is no wonder that I go to
seed in this manner of which

301
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,830
you so desperately disapprove.

302
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,710
Which useful position
had you in mind?

303
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,150
Any, sir. Give it to
me and I shall fill it.

304
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,710
HE SNEEZES

305
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,750
One more of those and you'll
lose YOUR position, sir.

306
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,950
As for you, let me see, you have...

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,550
HE SNEEZES Good God, man!

308
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,950
For pity's sake, Father.

309
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,110
Have him close the window,
the man is clearly ill.

310
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,230
Open all the windows.

311
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,350
I'm not blind, my son.

312
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,590
This clergyman's girl wishes
you to be a man of destiny.

313
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,750
She does not know that you,

314
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,990
like your mother, are weak

315
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,830
and skittish and doomed to fulfil no

316
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,630
function more useful than

317
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,870
that of a clothes horse.

318
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,990
HE GROANS

319
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,910
~ My dear fellow!
~ Leave him!

320
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,510
On your feet, sir.

321
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,700
Stand beside the window.

322
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,990
And you, sir, you've proved yourself
a failure in everything you've done.

323
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,910
And you shall have no assistance

324
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,110
in finding any occupation whilst

325
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,440
I am yet living and
master in this house.

326
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,150
I had thought to ask your
permission to marry your sister.

327
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,270
But I rather think it is her
permission I'd struggle to get.

328
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,110
Have some brandy in that, Henry.
It makes it taste much better.

329
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,760
It is Sunday, Jonathan. I
have a carriage to catch.

330
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,510
Arabella loves you. She merely...

331
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,150
~ I have tried.
~ She just wishes you to have purpose.

332
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,990
I have tried to buy an ironworks,

333
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,950
the smelting room gave me a headache.

334
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,390
I have tried to establish a business
to collect fossils at Lyme Regis.

335
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,350
~ Yes.
~ Much too rainy. Have you,
have you been to Lyme Regis?

336
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,670
Cannot your father...

337
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,480
My father delights in torturing
me, as he tortures his servants.

338
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,590
As he tortured my mother.

339
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,080
Jonathan, God will...

340
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,230
A way will become clear
to you, Jonathan.

341
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,280
All I've ever truly wished
for is your sister.

342
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,080
It often happens in the
most unexpected of ways.

343
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,830
Goodbye, Jonathan.

344
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,710
Do not drown yourself.

345
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
I will have one more.

346
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,280
KNOCKING ON DOOR

347
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,710
KNOCKING ON DOOR

348
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,560
HE STIRS

349
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,520
~ What?
~ I fear there's been a quarrel.
The door, it's quite jammed.

350
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,510
Come on, together.

351
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,190
The poor fellow is ill!

352
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,470
HE GROANS

353
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,720
This room is as cold
as a Scotsman's chimney!

354
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Father!

355
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,800
Father?

356
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,520
BELL TOLLS

357
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,670
She regrets her absence
in Cumberland.

358
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,670
She does not like to
think of me being alone

359
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,150
and friendless at such a time.

360
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,790
Well, I have an estate to run.

361
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,840
I'm not to be without
an occupation now.

362
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,310
~ What sort of an interval
do you think is appropriate?
~ Eh?

363
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,670
For me to ride up there and
ask for her hand, Jeremy.

364
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,430
To Cumberland!

365
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,070
What sort of period of mourning
do you think is fit?

366
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,870
A month? Two weeks?

367
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,460
Three days?

368
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,110
BELL RINGS

369
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,590
"And Mr Norrell, having taken a
London house for the season..."

370
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,590
I have not taken it,
I have bought it.

371
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,230
210 guineas.

372
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,590
".. having taken a London house for
the season, leaves us hungry to see

373
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,630
"which, if any, new wonders
he will perform

374
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,020
"after the miracle of York."

375
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,640
Miracle?

376
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,510
"The miracle of York."

377
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,030
"Are we to see the proof of
his genius with our own eyes?

378
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,590
"Has magic truly returned,
or is Mr Norrell

379
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,870
"simply a wealthier version

~ I have never...

381
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,310
I have contended with
this for 40 years.

382
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,990
Stiggers and disapproval.

383
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,710
Well, this is why we have
come here, is it not?

384
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,350
We have come to change that.

385
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,270
The Star has reprinted
Mr Segundus's letter...

386
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,260
with illustrations.

387
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,390
Why is London so expensive?

388
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,150
So noisy?

389
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,960
And the smell.

390
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,910
Is that supposed to be me?

391
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,270
With a beard?

392
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,030
And a pointy hat!

393
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,790
They intend no disrespect, sir.

394
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,920
That is what most folk believe
a magician to look like.

395
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,270
The magic of the old country.

396
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,030
The magic of the Raven King,

397
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,950
300 years gone...

398
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,140
and turned to feathers.

399
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,900
The Raven King.

400
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,550
These men give the practice of
magic such an appalling name.

401
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,950
Well, if nothing else, sir,

402
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,400
you should pull that picture
out of their heads.

403
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,350
Whoa!

404
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,110
Listen.

405
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,270
This is what you have worked for.

406
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,430
This is your great opportunity.

407
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,390
If all goes as it should here,

408
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,030
when folk think of a magician...

409
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,430
They will think of myself.

410
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,640
Courage, sir. Charm.

411
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,470
He is the Secretary of State for War.

412
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,030
Remember what a gift
it is that you offer,

413
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,950
then I am sure he
will be your friend.

414
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,550
'You, sir, are an
embarrassment to your party'

415
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,670
and to this whole house.

416
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,070
THEY CHEER

417
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,190
Our forces are hopelessly
outnumbered by the French.

418
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,150
We stay in Salamanca and be
massacred, or lead our troops

419
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,270
over the mountains and
leave them to the snow.

420
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,030
This is a final disgrace.

421
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,390
The final act of a criminally
incompetent government.

422
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,750
Shame upon you. Shame!

423
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,920
THEY ALL SHOUT

424
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,390
Order. Sir Walter Pole.

425
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,430
The honourable gentleman is
well known for his excellent

426
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,150
impromptu speeches, and it is
good to know that the time he

427
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,230
~ spends preparing them is not wasted.
~ LAUGHTER

428
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,550
I would have been happy
to hear a deal less of it.

429
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,750
But as Napoleon himself has said,

430
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,390
you should never interrupt your
enemy when he is making a mistake.

431
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,510
'There will be no retreat
from Salamanca.

432
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,310
But I am a man of my word and
a custodian of English blood.

433
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,710
There will be no retreat!

434
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,000
CHEERING

435
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,150
There will be a massacre.

436
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,070
MAN: Well done, Sir
Walter. Well done.

437
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,680
Sir Walter!

438
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,310
Sir Walter!

439
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,900
Sir Walt...

440
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,070
What assistance may I be to you, sir?

441
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,920
I have an appointment with
Sir Walter to talk about...

442
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,150
.. magic.

443
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,960
Ah, you are the magician. Mr Norris?

444
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,190
Norrell.

445
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,830
Sir Walter begs humbly that he
may receive you at his private

446
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,350
residence.

447
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,110
DOOR OPENS

448
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,670
Aha, I'm very glad to meet you, sir.

449
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,990
It seems London talks of little else
but the extraordinary Mr Norrell.

450
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,150
Please. Mr Norrell
is a magician, ma'am.

451
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,550
A person of great reputation in
his native county of Yorkshire.

452
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,790
And where are your
fairy servants, sir?

453
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,910
Are they visible only to yourself
or may others see them?

454
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,070
Oh, uh, fairies are
mythological creatures, madam.

455
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,590
Mythological?

456
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,230
I meant to say that they do no...

457
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,150
They... they did not exist in
the way the stories have them.

458
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,950
They're a poisonous race, their
help is always regretted, it is

459
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,390
always a heavy price.

460
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,230
You are not at all what
I expected, eh, Stephen?

461
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,590
I had not formed a picture
of Mr Norrell, sir.

462
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,750
I had heard you were
a practical magician.

463
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,190
I hope you are not offended.

464
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,670
It's a great relief to see that
you are nothing of the sort.

465
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,670
You are a theoretical
magician, I imagine.

466
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,990
SHE COUGHS

467
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,830
They say you have
something to ask me?

468
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,070
SHE COUGHS

469
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,630
I...

470
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,870
W... That is

471
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,550
to say, I beg your pardon but
I am in fact a practical,

472
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,710
erm, magician.

473
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,390
But I very earnestly hope that
I will not by this admission

474
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,190
lose your good opinion.

475
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,790
No, by no means.

476
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,630
The... the misapprehension
under which you labour...

477
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,950
by which I mean of course the
belief that all practical

478
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,990
magicians are charlatans,
arises from the appalling

479
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,590
idleness of English magicians
in the last 300 years.

480
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,750
I have performed one small
feat of modern magic, which

481
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,190
the people of York were kind enough
to say that they found astounding.

482
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,910
I am come, Sir Walter, to offer you

483
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,700
my help in our present difficulties.

484
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,630
~ You mean the war?
~ Yes.

485
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,710
My dear sir, what has magic
to do with the war?

486
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,990
I believe I have heard
what you did in York

487
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,550
and I am sure the housewives
were very grateful.

488
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,830
But I can scarcely see how such
magic may be applied to the war.

489
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,150
True enough, soldiers get very dirty.

490
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,270
Sir, I made half-a-hundred stone
figures talk in York Minster.

491
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,390
It was nothing to do with housewives.

492
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,310
COUGHING

493
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,310
My fiancee, Miss Wintertowne.

494
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,500
Oh, er, enchante, miss.

495
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,190
Very fond of magic myself.

496
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,070
There's a wonderful street
magician - Vinculus.

497
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,670
~ He's all lies and doom.
~ Oh, well, no, street magicians
are the very worst.

498
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,060
All magicians are vagabonds.

499
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,070
My dear Emma is to be
married to Sir Walter

500
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,230
at St George's in ten days' time.

501
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,950
M... many congratulations.

502
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,070
SHE COUGHS

503
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,590
I am often ill myself.

504
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,150
I find some warm lemon and nutmeg...

505
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,630
SHE COUGHS

506
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,310
Mr Norrell, I'm not sure what
help you hope to offer us.

507
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,960
I am sorry to say it will not do.

508
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,910
Magic is not respectable, sir.

509
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,070
The government cannot
meddle in such things.

510
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,910
Frankly, had I better understood
what you were proposing to offer,

511
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,700
I would not have agreed to meet you.

512
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,640
CLOCK CHIMES

513
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,600
~ How'd it go?
~ Very well.

514
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,070
Tolerably well.

515
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,960
As bad as that, eh? Did
you do any magic for him?

516
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,270
This is not the way to the house.
Hanover Square is that way.

517
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,030
We are going to Lady Godesdone's
house. It's a soiree.

518
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,070
A party? I wish to go
home and read a book.

519
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,470
Powerful gentlemen spend
more time at parties

520
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,910
than they do in Parliament.

521
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,630
You cannot do this from the comfort
of your own fireside, sir.

522
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,220
We're not in Yorkshire any more.

523
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,800
CHATTER AND LAUGHTER

524
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,040
Pardon me. Excuse me.

525
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,710
I heard all the ladies of Yorkshire
may put out their dirty linen

526
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,470
in baskets at night, and in the
morning it is magically clean.

527
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,270
He is as rich as a very Jew.

528
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,390
A wealthy uncle died, leaving him
a large estate, Hurtfew Abbey.

529
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,950
~ It's in Yorkshire.
~ Wealthy uncles are in
short supply these days.

530
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,630
I was with him, only this morning, to hear
of the wonderful magic he's been doing.

531
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,590
What kind of wonderful magic
are we talking about, exactly?

532
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,550
The cleaning of laundry
is commonly known.

533
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,360
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER

534
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,480
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

535
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,070
Admit it, you don't know him.

536
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,430
On the contrary, nobody in
London knows him better.

537
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,790
We came here in the expectation of
seeing something very extraordinary,

538
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,430
such as we have read in the Times,

539
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,350
and instead we have been forced
to make our own entertainment.

540
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,550
That gentleman is reading a book!

541
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,990
I beg your pardon.

542
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,030
No, no, you do not know him as I.

543
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,830
Mr Norrell has a shrewd
notion of his own value.

544
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,750
A gentleman who buys a
house in Hanover Square.

545
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,790
~ I beg your pardon.
~ What!

546
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,640
I am Mr Norrell.

547
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,470
Oh!

548
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,510
Mr Norrell!

549
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,470
I can scarcely begin to express my
delight in making your acquaintance.

550
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,230
I had mistook you, sir.

551
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,470
But now that I behold you, I plainly
see you have the measured

552
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,200
and dignified air of
a magical scholar.

553
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,310
Lascelles, do you not think
Mr Norrell has the grave

554
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,950
and sober bearing of a scholar?

555
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,640
~ 'Spose so.
~ My name is Drawlight.

556
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:39,630
I have been your John the Baptist,
sir, preparing the way for you.

557
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,150
I knew we would be friends.

558
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:49,830
Here we are, chatting so
comfortably to one another.

559
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,230
This is all for you, sir.

560
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,030
Yes, I am becoming aware of that.

561
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,510
Let me announce you.

562
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,190
And I pray, do not think it
would be considered an insult

563
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,150
to the company if you were to
perform a trick or two of magic.

564
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,320
No, no, no, no... I...

565
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,310
GLASS TINKLES

566
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,750
My lords.

567
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,550
My, my lords, ladies and gentlemen,

568
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,430
may I introduce to
you my dear friend,

569
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,230
the saviour of English magic,

570
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,560
the magician of Hanover
Square, Mr Norrell.

571
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,120
He has disappeared.

572
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,870
DISHES CLATTER

573
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,960
Can I help you, sir?

574
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,870
The rain shall make a door for me.

575
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,390
And I shall walk through it.

576
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,550
Oh, yes, you think yourself
a very fine fellow.

577
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Hoarding books like
a miser hoards gold.

578
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,790
Open up!

579
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,350
Well, I have a book, sir.

580
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,830
A book you won't find in
your library, or any other.

581
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,590
It's written by the Raven King,

582
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,360
and it tells me all about you.

583
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,680
Vinculus, magician of Threadneedle
Street, at your service.

584
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,990
Well, know this, magician -

585
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,710
your coming was foretold long ago.

586
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,470
I've been expecting you
these past 20 years.

587
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,150
Now I've come to explain
your destiny to you,

588
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,430
as it is written in my book.

589
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,470
Oh, prophecies, is it!

590
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,630
Well, magic cannot
see into the future

591
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,310
and rascals who claim
otherwise are liars.

592
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,790
~ Childermass!
~ These are the words of the Raven King.

593
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,430
He was a charlatan, sir. Childermass!

594
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,550
~ Two magicians shall appear in England.
~ Two?

595
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,750
The name of one shall be Fearfulness,

596
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,270
the name of the other, Arrogance.

597
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,630
~ Did you say two?
~ Ssh.

598
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,790
The first shall fear me, the
second shall long to behold me.

599
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,070
The first shall bury his heart
in the dark wood beneath the snow,

600
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,630
yet still feel its ache.

601
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,790
The second shall see his dearest
possession in his enemy's hand.

602
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,580
Both will fail.

603
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,040
The nameless slave shall
be a king in a strange land.

604
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,590
I will return.

605
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,840
His words, sir, not mine.

606
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,840
I will return. There.

607
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,960
Goodbye.

608
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,390
HE SPITS

609
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,040
Childermass!

610
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,070
I want that man gone.

611
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,590
I want him run out of London.
You shall have some spells.

612
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,630
~ I don't need any spells. What did he want?
~ What?

613
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,190
The man put himself to a great deal of trouble
and risked a hanging. What did he want?

614
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,110
~ To give a prophecy from
the Raven King. Nonsense.
~ The Raven King?

615
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,630
He said he had a book. Nonsense.

616
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,590
But if he does have a book, I want it,
and then I want to go home to Yorkshire.

617
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,030
To Yorkshire? We've
only just moved here.

618
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,150
This house is not respectable
enough - such a tiny library.

619
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,990
No, you're doing it wrong. You've got dozens
of invitations to fancy houses and you,

620
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,150
you either turn them
down or you scarper.

621
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,270
That's not how you get things done.

622
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,870
Why do you not at least do some
magic here? Just show them.

623
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,910
I'm not a performing monkey.

624
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,150
Have Davy bring down
the packing boxes.

625
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,190
Do you wish to make a success
of this? Or do you not?

626
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,590
There.

627
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Take these spells.
Use them if you must.

628
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,030
One-penny spells, two-penny spells.
I got a guinea spell for you, sir.

629
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,990
Let me importune some fortune into
your sorry little life, sir.

630
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,950
Pull out your purses and procure
some curses. All right, darling?

631
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,270
For five shillings I'll confer
with the River Thames and find
that runaway husband of yours, eh?

632
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,270
No? How much for your pies, mate?

633
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
More than you've got.

634
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,840
Ah! Mr Norrell, sir.

635
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,990
Drawlight, hmm? Your
John the Baptist.

636
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,310
A moment of your time, sir.

637
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,560
HE SNORES

638
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,510
Ah!

639
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,270
Ah, a spell to make an
obstinate man leave London.

640
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,190
One spell to discover what my
enemy is doing presently. Cheap.

641
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,830
Well, you can tell the magician of Hanover
Square that his spells have no effect on me.

642
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,350
That's because I haven't cast them yet.
There's a true magician in England now.

643
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,110
I know magicians and I know
magic and I say this -

644
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,000
all magicians lie, that one
more than most. Oh, yes.

645
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,120
I think you and I had better
have a chat, don't you?

646
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,960
Why?

647
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,950
You left so suddenly last night, sir,

648
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,390
and I had so much to say and I'm
sure we will be such friends.

649
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,310
Davy, you should use
some calf-skin gloves.

650
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,510
Do mind the spines,
Lucas, the spines.

651
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,550
You are not leaving, sir?

652
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,790
I came here to restore
magic to respectability

653
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,110
and to do some good for the war.

654
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,430
I am clearly bound to fail. These
men in government will not listen.

655
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,950
Sir, if you will permit
me. I know these men.

656
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,280
Just a spell or two would have
them embracing you like a brother.

657
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,070
I only ask that I be the gentleman
to introduce you to society.

658
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,390
Just one small piece of magic.

659
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,390
Like you did for the
housewives in Yorkshire.

660
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,030
I have never washed any linen in my
life, by magical means or otherwise.

661
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,990
Who invented this nonsense?

662
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,510
I suppose it is no matter who.

663
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,150
So where's this book of yours?

664
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,830
You'll never have my book.
You'll never even see it.

665
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,550
~ It's my inheritance.
~ From who? The Raven King?

666
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,540
Well, you can't hide
the truth from me.

667
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,790
The cards of Marseilles.
Shall we see your fortune?

668
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,240
MAN: Curses! Curses
upon your neighbour!

669
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,550
For the present, your actions are
governed by a hermit - Norrell.

670
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,350
We knew that already.

671
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,000
Ah, this one tells me you've weighed
your choices and made a decision.

672
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,960
This one tells me what it
is - you're going wandering.

673
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,990
You've a message to deliver.

674
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,790
To him.

675
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,780
The Knight of Wands.

676
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,230
You may expect a meeting,

677
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,310
leading to an ordeal of some
sort, perhaps even death.

678
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,230
The cards don't say whether
or not you'll survive.

679
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,790
But regardless, you will
achieve your purpose.

680
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,510
~ Do you know what I am yet?
~ Well, there's nothing here that says

681
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,430
you're anything more
than a charlatan.

682
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,870
Then you won't mind if I tell
a fortune myself then, will you?

683
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,710
My fortune won't interest you.

684
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,070
Not yours, his.

685
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,120
~ Norrell's?
~ He is at a crossroads, your magician.

686
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,870
Let's see which path he chooses.

687
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,320
Shall we?

688
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,580
Someone's left a dirty
thumbprint on't card.

689
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,780
I drew these myself. There's
only one king in the pack.

690
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,070
Tell that to the magician
of Hanover Square.

691
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,840
His past, his present, his future.

692
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,020
He is coming, you know.

693
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,520
The raven is coming.

694
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,670
And his spell is about to be cast.

695
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,560
HE CACKLES

696
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,350
I do not wish to attend soirees,
dinner parties or salons.

697
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,190
I have offered my services to the
country, they have been declined.

698
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,710
I shall return to Yorkshire.

699
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,700
Good day, gentlemen.

700
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,070
Well, sir, you have your revenge,

701
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,510
~ at least as far as Walter Pole is concerned.
~ Sorry?

702
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,750
Sir Walter's bride
is dead. Poor thing.

703
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,670
A thousand pounds a
year, and quite dead.

704
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,160
~ She only contrived to remain
alive till the end of the week.
~ Dead?

705
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,550
The young lady? That
is most unexpected.

706
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,590
On the contrary, nothing
was more likely.

707
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,870
Sir Walter's need of the
money is quite desperate.

708
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,230
He spent a thousand pounds
on the last election alone.

709
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,230
It's a very dangerous thing, to
bring someone back from the dead.

710
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,950
It has not been done in 300 years.

711
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,550
No, no, I could not attempt it.

712
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,590
Indeed, sir, no-one proposes
that you should.

713
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,550
Well... No, I know the form of it.

714
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,590
But it is precisely the sort of
magic I've set my face against.

715
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,840
It relies so much upon...

716
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,070
Well, that is to say, the outcome,
it is quite unpredictable.

717
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,120
It is quite out of
the magician's power.

718
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,710
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

719
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,110
I shall not even think of it.

720
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,110
No, sir, I understand.

721
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,710
You have in mind a
great act of magic.

722
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,440
A testament to your...
extraordinary powers.

723
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,870
I must say I think the
idea an excellent one.

724
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,390
Should you succeed,

725
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,940
all the Poles in England
will be on your doorstep.

726
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,830
I have laboured all this time
to make magic - my profession -

727
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,510
respectable in the eyes of these
men and then still, they despise me.

728
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,110
Oh, my dear Mr Norrell,

729
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,430
such an opportunity is
unlikely to occur again.

730
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,430
With one stroke, you return
to us that sweet young woman

731
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,840
whose death no-one can hear
of without shedding a tear.

732
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,470
And you re-establish magic
as a power in the realm

733
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,120
for generations to come.

734
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,520
There is scarcely any form
of magic more dangerous.

735
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,660
It is dangerous to
the magician, and...

736
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,630
.. furthermore it is
dangerous to the subject.

737
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,950
But the subject, as
you term her, is dead.

738
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,470
What worse fate can befall her?

739
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,470
And a brave magician, surely...

740
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,430
I will need to send for more books.

741
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,310
I'll make an excellent
landowner, Jeremy.

742
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,910
She will tell me that I will be bored

743
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,310
but I shall tell her about
my plans for alms houses,

744
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,030
and demonstrate my concern for
the plight of the common man.

745
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,310
The common man over there

746
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,550
is attempting to violently accost
the other common man, sir.

747
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,310
~ Stay back!
~ YELLING

748
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,470
~ I don't suppose you brought
a set of pistols, did you?
~ No, sir.

749
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,390
Jeremy, go and fetch
me a large stick.

750
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,790
I say!

751
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,310
You! We are armed and ready.

752
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,230
Sh! Sir, shush.

753
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,310
~ What?
~ You'll wake him up.

754
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,790
~ Who?
~ The man. Under the hedge.

755
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,190
He's a magician.

756
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,150
If you wake a magician
before his time,

757
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,310
his dreams come after
you and haunt you.

758
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,030
He's woken up!

759
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,840
Don't touch him.

760
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,190
~ Knight of wands.
~ What did he say?

761
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,030
Two magicians shall
appear in England.

762
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,880
~ What did he say?
~ The name of one shall be Fearfulness.

763
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,310
The name of the other - Arrogance.

764
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,470
Both will fail. My
name is Vinculus, sir.

765
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,990
For three days now, I have
been walking westward

766
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,750
in search of a man destined
to become a great magician.

767
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,340
Due to certain mystical signs...

768
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,030
.. I can see that it is you.

769
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,230
Two magicians shall
appear in England.

770
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,750
The first shall fear me. The
second shall long to behold me.

771
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,190
The first shall be governed
by thieves and murderers.

772
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,470
The second shall conspire
at his own destruction.

773
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,310
You do not make it
sound very appealing.

774
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,300
Choose someone else.

775
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,710
~ I did not choose you, magician.
~ HE LAUGHS

776
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,550
You were chosen long ago.

777
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,550
Well, whoever did the choosing will
be disappointed. I am no magician.

778
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,430
Then buy these two
spells from me, sir.

779
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,950
They'll get you started.

780
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,750
I got them from a great
magician in London.

781
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,990
How much do you want for them?

782
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,590
Seven shillings and
sixpence, sir. Cough up.

783
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,790
All right, all right.

784
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,030
The nameless slave shall
be a king in a strange land.

785
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,430
~ Here, you! Let's have you. Workhouse.
~ That's your lot.
~ Vagrancy.

786
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,830
I'm not a vagrant, sir.

787
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,070
I have money.

788
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,510
Who gave him money?

789
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,430
~ For always and forever...
~ I think it's time we were going, Jeremy.

790
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,870
.. I pray remember me, upon
the moors, beneath the stars.

791
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,230
Good day, gentlemen.

792
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,870
I will return. His
words, sir, not mine.

793
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,720
~ HE LAUGHS
~ I will return.

794
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,070
When I take over the management
of my own estate...

795
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,270
You always told me you
hated farming, Jonathan.

796
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,710
Will such a thing do for you?

797
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,390
~ Well, I...
~ You once said

798
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,190
that you would rather
put out your own eyes

799
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,350
than spend one moment
managing the estate.

800
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,950
Very well, I'm going to
study magic. Will that do?

801
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,230
Why on earth would
you want to do that?

802
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,510
I met a man under a hedge who
told me I was a magician.

803
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,070
~ Did you indeed?
~ You do not believe me.
~ No.

804
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,240
On the contrary, it's all of a piece
with your usual way of doing things.

805
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,510
I purchased two spells from
the man under the hedge.

806
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,830
Would you like to see one?

807
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,510
~ Very dirty.
~ We magicians do not regard a little dirt.

808
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,830
Ancient, mysterious
spells such as these.

809
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,390
Second of February?

810
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,910
Three days ago.

811
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,870
Indeed.

812
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,350
"A spell to make an obstinate
man leave London."

813
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,950
"One spell to discover what mine
enemy is doing presently."

814
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,870
Why on earth would you want
to make people leave London?

815
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,430
These are horrible, Jonathan.

816
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,350
I require a mirror
and something dead.

817
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,750
Er, Jeremy, those flowers.

818
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,900
I think we can find you
a mirror, Jonathan.

819
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,750
Now, madam, an occupation.

820
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,390
If I make a success of this,

821
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,240
~ might I then presume...
~ Here we are.

822
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,590
Thank you. And, er, now...

823
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,670
The flowers must be
arranged like so...

824
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,080
and, er, then I draw a circle
on the mirror, like this.

825
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,630
And then I quarter the circle.

826
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,790
Jonathan, where did
you get this nonsense?

827
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,070
From the man under the hedge.

828
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,120
~ Henry, do at least try it.
~ Henry, that...

829
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,920
That is not your ceiling.

830
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,990
Who on earth is he?

831
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,240
And why is he your enemy?

832
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,230
Do you owe him money?

833
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,670
I do not think so.

834
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,310
He could be a banker, it looks
a little like the counting house.

835
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,910
Well, Arabella, good magicians
conjure up fairy spirits

836
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,830
and long-dead kings.

837
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,380
I appear to have summoned
the spirit of a banker.

838
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,990
But at least...

839
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,840
I AM a magician.

840
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,830
I wish with all my heart, Sir Walter,

841
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,870
that I might invite you up with
me to see what it is I do.

842
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,950
But the nature of this
magic demands solitude.

843
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,630
I will, I hope, have the honour
of showing you some magic

844
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,030
on another occasion.

845
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,270
Do not send them away, sir.

846
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,550
Gather as many of them around
the bed as possible.

847
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,110
Impress the servants.

848
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,910
We should have brought some Chinese
powders to throw on the fire.

849
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,390
Bang!

850
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,740
Er, I wish to go to where
Miss Wintertowne is.

851
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,870
This way, sir.

852
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,230
We will stand quietly in the corner,
sir, and afford any assistance.

853
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,280
~ No.
~ But, sir, we...

854
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,960
Gentlemen.

855
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,550
I have in mind to write a play
based on this sorry affair.

856
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,470
I shall call it...

857
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,510
..'Tis Pity She's A Corpse.

858
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,980
HE SNIGGERS

859
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,120
RATTLING

860
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,800
CREAKING

861
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,360
HE SCREAMS

862
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,680
Who in the world are you?

863
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,310
I am the greatest
magician of the age.

864
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,360
I... I am the man who is destined
to restore magic to England.

865
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,030
Well, obviously you are that,
or I should not be here.

866
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,030
But who are you?

867
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,360
What magic have you done?

868
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,350
Who was your master?

869
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,550
I had no master, I taught
myself... from books.

870
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,590
Books?

871
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,990
There are some rather helpful
books these days.

872
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,230
At least, they...

873
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,780
They might be helpful, when...
they're considered all together.

874
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:53,160
Should I agree to restore this
beautiful young woman to life...

875
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,750
.. what would be my reward?

876
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,310
~ What sort of thing...?
~ Oh, my wishes are the most moderate things

877
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,710
in the world.

878
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,470
I simply wish to be able to
aid you in your endeavours.

879
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,960
To advise you in all matters
and to guide your studies.

880
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,030
Oh, and you must take
care to tell the world

881
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:23,080
that your greatest achievements
are due, in large part, to me.

882
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,310
W... Were I the sort of magician
who entrusts his business

883
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,900
to other persons then I would...

884
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,870
But I fear, unfortunately, that
I have no notion to employ you

885
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,870
or indeed any other member
of your race ever again.

886
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,710
Well...

887
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,230
this is most ungrateful indeed.

888
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,000
Perhaps I would do better
to speak to the other one.

889
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,110
~ The other who?
~ The other magician.

890
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,270
No, there is no other magician.
I am the only one.

891
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,990
Of course there is another magician.

892
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,750
He is your dearest friend
in all the world.

893
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,670
I have no friends.

894
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,180
So you will not help me?

895
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,400
I must confess...

896
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,750
.. that in recent centuries,

897
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:22,800
I have grown somewhat tired of the
society of my cousins and servants.

898
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,830
I have need of new companions

899
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,560
and this young woman would be
a charming companion indeed.

900
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,910
Grant me half her life
and the deal is done.

901
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,230
~ What would her friends and family say...?
~ Half a life

902
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,220
is better than none.

903
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,230
How long is a life?

904
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,420
How long would you like?

905
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,790
Well, let us suppose that she might
have lived until she was...

906
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,980
94.

907
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,260
And she is 19. That's
another 75 years.

908
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,700
75 years, then.

909
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,520
Exactly half of which belongs to me.

910
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,440
~ Shall we sign something?
~ No.

911
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,340
No.

912
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,670
I should take something of the
lady's to signify my claim.

913
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,230
~ One of her rings?
~ No.

914
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,480
Ah... I have it.

915
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,550
And then you will go back.

916
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,140
I am sorry?

917
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,070
After you've finished the spell,

918
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,220
you will go away not
to come back any more.

919
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,600
You need never see me again.

920
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,070
SHRIEKING

921
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,710
Emma! Miss Wintertowne.

922
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,900
What are you doing, man?

923
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,030
Open this door!

924
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,180
For the love of Christ,
sir, open this door.

925
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,620
What have you done?

926
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,270
SHE GASPS AND CHOKES

927
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,320
Oh, my Lord, my Lord.

928
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,230
Emma.

929
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,220
You've been wicked.

930
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,520
It is not right you did not
tell me how poorly I was.

931
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,030
I do believe for a moment
I may have been dead,

932
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,920
though I do not seem to be
dead presently. How unusual.

933
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,630
And Walter, I rather like
you in black. Let us dance.

934
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,510
Emma...

935
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,160
Your finger.

936
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,510
I don't feel it. Mmm. Dance with me.

937
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,240
SHE LAUGHS

938
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,310
A miracle!

939
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,910
The magician of Hanover Square has
restored the young lady to life.

940
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,830
My dear friend, Mr Norrell.

941
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,630
He has performed that which
medicine could not.

942
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,270
Physicians had abandoned her.

943
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:25,400
The poor young lady... Restored
to life and to dance!
