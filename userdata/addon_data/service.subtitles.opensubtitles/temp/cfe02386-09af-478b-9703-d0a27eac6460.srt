2
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,596
Remember...

3
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:35,460
I love you.

4
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,684
I love you, Thomas.

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,408
Mom!

6
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,523
Mom!

7
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,085
Thomas...

8
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,928
it's okay.

9
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,240
No, no, no!

10
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,611
Thomas!

11
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,121
Thomas!

12
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,131
Thomas!

13
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,886
Wake up! We gotta go! Come on!

14
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,927
Let's go! Let's go! We gotta go!

15
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,082
You all right? You all right?

16
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,241
Wait, wait, wait!

17
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,929
Where are you going? We don't have time!

18
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,127
Come on!

19
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,601
Get out of here!

20
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,769
Cranks! We got Cranks!

21
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,763
Gotta move! Not safe out here, kid!

22
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,160
Got a swarm to the flank!

23
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,606
Go, kid! Go, go!

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,482
Set a perimeter!
Hold them back on the right side!

25
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,289
Come on, kids, let's go!
Let's go! Move it! Come on!

26
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,130
Keep moving! Keep moving!

27
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,441
Tell him to take off! We're clear!

28
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,765
You kids doing all right?

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Sorry about all the fuss.
We had ourselves a bit of a swarm.

30
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,689
Who are you?

31
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,761
I'm the reason you're all still alive.

32
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,002
It's my intention to keep you that way.

33
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,841
Now, come with me.
We'll get you kids squared away.

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,891
You can call me Mr. Janson.
I run this place.

35
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,002
For us it is a sanctuary,
safe from the horrors of the outside world.

36
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,642
You all should think of it
as a way station.

37
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,565
Kind of a home between homes.
Watch yourselves.

38
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,527
That mean you're taking us home?

39
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,203
A home of sorts.

40
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,644
Sadly, there wouldn't be much left
of wherever you came from.

41
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,325
But we do have a place for you.

42
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,010
A refuge, outside the Scorch,
where WICKED will never find you again.

43
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,168
How does that sound?

44
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,684
Why are you helping us?

45
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,684
Let's just say the world out there
is in a rather precarious situation.

46
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,081
We're all hanging on
by a very thin thread.

47
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,368
The fact that you kids
can survive the Flare virus...

48
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,491
makes you the best chance
of humanity's continued survival.

49
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,171
Unfortunately, it also makes you a target,
as no doubt by now you've noticed.

50
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,086
Beyond this door lies the beginning
of your new lives.

51
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,929
First things first...

52
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,289
let's do something about that smell.

53
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,601
All right!

54
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,046
Oh, man!

55
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,366
Feels great!

56
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,089
Frypan, how you feel over there?

57
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,203
Wait, what is that?

58
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,001
Just a little cocktail.
Calcium, folate, vitamins A through Z.

59
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,891
Pretty much everything
you've been deprived of out there.

60
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,530
Try to relax.

61
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,444
Sure you got enough there?

62
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,881
Evening, Dr. Crawford.

63
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,367
Good evening.
How are the new arrivals holding up?

64
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,965
So far, so good.

65
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,770
All right.

66
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,403
And you must be Teresa.

67
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,481
Thomas?

68
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,887
Yeah?

69
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,731
Come with me, please.

70
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,528
Thomas, thank you for seeing me.

71
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,567
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

72
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,169
I was just hoping we might get a moment
to chat in private, away from the others.

73
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,121
Well...

74
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,082
I won't take up too much of your time.

75
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,770
I really only have one question.

76
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,770
What do you remember about WICKED?

77
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,771
You're not in trouble.

78
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,931
We're just having a conversation.
I'm just trying to understand.

79
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,769
Understand what?

80
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,161
Whose side are you on?

81
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,124
I remember I used to work for WICKED.

82
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,046
I remember that they sent me
into the maze.

83
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,244
I remember watching my friends die
in front of me.

84
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,082
I'm on their side.

85
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,851
Interesting.

86
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,209
You say you worked for WICKED,
but they sent you into the maze.

87
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,771
Why would they do something like that?

88
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,083
I don't know. Maybe you should've
asked them before you killed them all.

89
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,286
I'll be sure to keep that in mind.

90
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,170
Enjoy the rest of your stay.

91
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,206
That's it?

92
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,249
Yeah, you've told me
everything I need to know.

93
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,529
You and your friends have all
been cleared to join the others.

94
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,849
Soon you'll all be moving
on to greener pastures.

95
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,007
Wait.

96
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,126
Others?

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,166
Hey, Thomas!

98
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,644
Hey, Minho, what's going on?

99
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,689
We weren't the only maze. Come on.

100
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,323
And there was this big, loud explosion,
and these guys came out of nowhere.

101
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,243
Started shooting up the place.

102
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,640
It was intense.

103
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,082
They pulled us out of the maze
and brought us here.

104
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,730
What about the rest?

105
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,606
The other people left behind in the maze,
what happened to them?

106
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,766
I don't know.

107
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,048
I guess WICKED still has them.

108
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,129
- How long you guys been here?
- Not long.

109
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,845
Just a day or two.

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,446
That kid over there has been here
the longest.

111
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,209
Almost a week.

112
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,404
His maze was nothing but girls.

113
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,641
Really?

114
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,808
Some guys have all the luck.

115
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,085
Good evening, gentlemen. Ladies.

116
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,443
You all know how this works.
If you hear your name called...

117
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,128
please rise in an orderly fashion,
join my colleagues behind me...

118
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,930
where they will escort you
to the eastern wing.

119
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,287
Your new lives are about to begin.

120
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,748
Connor.

121
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,362
- Evelyn.
- Ev!

122
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,068
Justin.

123
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,811
Peter.

124
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,845
Allison.

125
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,446
Squiggy.

126
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,211
All right. Settle down.

127
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,487
Franklin. And Abigail.

128
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,290
Now, now, don't get discouraged.
If I could take more, I would.

129
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,162
There's always tomorrow.
Your time will come.

130
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,130
Go on, eat up.

131
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,211
Where are they going?

132
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,131
Far from here.

133
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,324
Lucky bastards.

134
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,405
Some kind of farm. A safe place.

135
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,006
They can only take in
a couple of people at a time.

136
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,725
What the hell?

137
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,686
Hey, Teresa?

138
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,007
Teresa!

139
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,327
Hey, hey, hey.

140
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,970
Where are they taking her?

141
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,289
They just have to run a few more tests.

142
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,647
Don't worry,
they'll be done with her soon.

143
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,529
Is she okay?

144
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,400
She's fine.

145
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,164
I got top bunk.

146
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,924
Too slow.

147
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,484
I could get used to this.

148
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,690
Yeah. It's not bad.

149
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,527
Hey, what do you think
those guys want with Teresa?

150
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,961
Now, if there's one thing I know about
that girl, she can take care of herself.

151
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,049
Don't worry about it.

152
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,047
Hey.

153
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,326
Down here.

154
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,530
Oh, my God.

155
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,806
Come on. Follow me.

156
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,201
What?

157
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,045
Hurry, this way.

158
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,206
Come on.

159
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,889
Hey, wait a second.
What the hell are we doing?

160
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,890
Come on, we're gonna miss it.

161
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,928
What the hell am I doing?

162
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,491
What are we doing?

163
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,686
Come here.

164
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,081
Watch.

165
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,642
What the hell was that?

166
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,287
They bring in new ones every night
like clockwork.

167
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,085
You know what they do with them?

168
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,122
I don't know.
This is as far as I've ever gotten.

169
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,765
The vents don't even go
into that section.

170
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,771
But once they go through that door,
they don't come back out.

171
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,846
I don't think anybody
ever really leaves this place.

172
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,643
Come on. We've gotta go
before somebody notices we're gone.

173
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,889
Why did you show me this?

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,321
Because maybe the others
will listen to you.

175
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,247
There's something weird going on here.
And I know you think so too.

176
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,729
Hey, wait.

177
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,685
What's your name?

178
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,691
Aris.

179
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,201
Alice.

180
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,046
Barry.

181
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,371
Walt.

182
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,045
Edgar.

183
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,442
- Samantha.
- I wanna know what's through that door.

184
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,811
- Aaron.
- Now, we've been over this.

185
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,247
You said they were covered up,
so you don't know what you saw.

186
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,640
- Dennis.
- It could've been anything under there.

187
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,350
I know exactly what I saw.
They were bodies.

188
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,608
Aris said they bring in
a new batch every night.

189
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,171
Who the hell is Aris?

190
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,367
Henry.

191
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,166
- Tim.
- Well, I'm sold.

192
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,001
And last but not least, David.

193
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,887
Thank you for your attention.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

194
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,887
Okay, until we know anything for certain,
we should just keep our heads down...

195
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,691
and try not to draw any attention
to ourselves, all right?

196
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,286
What is he doing?

197
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,805
I think he's drawing
attention to himself.

198
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,522
Hang on. You weren't called.

199
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,564
- I know, I'm just gonna be a second.
- This is a restricted area, kid.

200
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,321
I just wanna see my friend.
Can you let me through?

201
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,606
Get your ass back in that chair.

202
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,122
Just remember, you are always being
monitored. Breaking the rules...

203
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,287
Back off!

204
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,244
What's your problem, man?
What the hell, huh?

205
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,731
- Back off!
- Why won't you let me see her?

206
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,161
- Control your friend!
- What's happening here?

207
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,091
Thomas?

208
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,129
I thought we could trust each other.

209
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,486
You know we're all
on the same team here.

210
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,646
Are we?

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,480
Get them to their bunks.

212
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,241
Get your asses in there! All of you!

213
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,171
What the hell was that about?

214
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,084
You didn't really think
they were just gonna let you through?

215
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,810
Nah, of course I didn't.

216
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,487
I'm gonna find out
what's on the other side of that door.

217
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,721
Right.

218
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,651
Newt, they're hiding something. Okay?

219
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,410
These people are not
who they say they are.

220
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,607
No, Thomas, you don't know that!

221
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,448
The only thing that we do know
is that they helped rescue us from WICKED.

222
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,683
They gave us new clothes. They gave us food.
They gave us a proper bed.

223
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,605
Some of us haven't had that
in a long time.

224
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,602
- Yeah, but...
- Some of us a lot longer than others.

225
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,762
Hey, Thomas.

226
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,921
What the...

227
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,321
You got it, didn't you?

228
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,448
Yeah. Let's go.

229
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,210
All right, look, maybe you guys are right.
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

230
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,649
But I got to find out for sure.
Just cover for me.

231
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,325
I'll be back as soon as I can.

232
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,970
What the hell?

233
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,642
Teresa?

234
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,600
It's Rachel.

235
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,490
They took her the first night.

236
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,922
I told her it was going to be okay.

237
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,045
You sure this can't wait?

238
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,085
She was very specific, sir.
She wanted to speak with you personally.

239
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,681
As if I don't have enough to deal with.

240
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,329
Just bear with me.
I'm getting some interference from the storm.

241
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,848
Come on. It's good enough.
Make the connection.

242
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,645
Good evening, Doctor Paige.

243
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,325
Lovely to see you again.

244
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
Although I admit...

245
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,764
I wasn't expecting to hear from you
quite so soon.

246
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,524
Change of plans, Janson.

247
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,361
I'll be arriving a little sooner
than expected. First thing tomorrow.

248
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,803
We'll be delighted to have you.

249
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,651
I think you'll be pleased
with the progress we've made.

250
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,083
As you can see, early results
have been extremely promising.

251
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,730
Whatever it is you've been doing
to them in there, it's working.

252
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,209
Not well enough.

253
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,689
I just received board approval.

254
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,448
I want all the remaining subjects sedated
and prepped for harvest by the time I arrive.

255
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,970
Doctor Paige, we are going
as fast as we can.

256
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,201
We are still running tests...

257
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,089
Try something faster.

258
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,770
Until I can guarantee their security,
this is the best plan.

259
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,681
Ma'am, security is my job.
We're on 24 hour lockdown here.

260
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,251
I am assuring you...

261
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,801
the assets are secure.

262
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,088
Have you found the Right Arm?

263
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,127
Not yet.

264
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,765
We tracked them as far as the mountains.

265
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
So they're still out there.

266
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,761
And they've already hit
two of our installations.

267
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,363
They want these kids as badly as we do.
And I cannot...

268
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,331
I cannot afford another loss.

269
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,131
Not now, when I am so close to a cure.

270
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,202
If you are not up to the task,
I will find someone who is.

271
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,964
That won't be necessary.

272
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,807
Might I suggest we start
with the most recent arrivals.

273
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,281
Just get it done.

274
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,201
Janson.

275
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,646
I don't want them to feel any pain.

276
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,804
They won't feel a thing.

277
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,068
Thomas!

278
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,687
We gotta go. We gotta go right now.

279
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,683
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What do you mean, "We gotta go?"

280
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,365
They're coming. Come on. We gotta go.

281
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,766
They're coming for us.

282
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,764
- Paige. She's still alive.
- What happened in there?

283
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,842
Aris, what happened?

284
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,570
Thomas, can you just calm down
and talk to us.

285
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,529
- She's still alive.
- Who's she? Teresa?

286
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,442
- Ava.
- Ava?

287
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,371
- Will you just turn around and talk to us?
- It's WICKED!

288
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,001
It's still WICKED.

289
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,201
It's always been WICKED.

290
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,606
Thomas.

291
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,803
What did you see?

292
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,321
Come on, come on.

293
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,847
Okay, let's go.

294
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,411
You guys go ahead.
There's something I gotta do.

295
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,607
What are you talking about?

296
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,088
Trust me, it's important. You guys wanna
get outta here, right? Just go.

297
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,765
- I'll go with him.
- Okay, Winston, go! Go! Come on.

298
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,081
You sure we can trust this kid?

299
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,751
You don't want to know
where we'd be without him.

300
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,647
What are you kids doing out?

301
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,762
I want this place locked down.
Call everyone in.

302
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,809
No one leaves until
everyone's accounted for.

303
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,811
- Tell me you've got eyes on them.
- Still looking, still looking.

304
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,889
Come on, come on, come on.

305
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,647
There.

306
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,122
Who is that?

307
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,807
Crawford. Going after the girl.

308
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,087
- Get everyone to the med wing.
- Yes, sir.

309
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,241
I want them alive.

310
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,922
Freeze! Stay where you are!

311
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,680
- Why are they shooting at us?
- I've spotted them!

312
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,966
- They're in L-3!
- Minho!

313
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,724
- I'm in pursuit!
- What the hell are you doing?

314
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,041
Minho!

315
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,125
Shit, Minho!

316
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,082
Okay. Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

317
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,888
Dr. Crawford, are you here to...
Wait, wait. Okay, okay.

318
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,761
Where is she? Where is she!

319
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,241
Get over!

320
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,842
Get down!

321
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,047
- Teresa.
- Get down!

322
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,964
- Okay, hands, give me your hands!
- Just do what he says.

323
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,122
- What did they do to you?
- Thomas?

324
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,960
- Give me your hands!
- You're never gonna get away with this.

325
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,611
- What's going on?
- We gotta leave right now. Come on.

326
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,762
Guys? They're coming! Where do we go?

327
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,286
Frypan! Move!

328
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,450
Get back! Get back!

329
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,120
They've got the door barricaded.
Send backup!

330
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,761
Okay, we gotta get outta here!
Where do we go?

331
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,160
- Push!
- Everyone stand back!

332
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,528
Come on!

333
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,241
Newt! Help, help!

334
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,647
Ready?

335
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,485
Go, go, go!

336
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,369
- Get out of the way!
- Come on, come on!

337
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,927
- Come on, come on!
- Get someone on the other side!

338
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,366
Watch your feet!

339
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,488
- Hurry! Let's go!
- Come on, move! Move! Move!

340
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,668
Thomas!

341
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,068
Let's go!

342
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,804
Stay behind me!

343
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,128
Shit. Okay, come on!

344
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,405
Stop!

345
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,245
There it is! There it is!

346
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,886
Converge on level 3.

347
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,530
All R-16 personnel...

348
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,882
non-lethal force only.

349
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,847
Shit. Come on!

350
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,650
No, no, no!

351
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,086
Thomas!

352
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,731
Open this door, Janson!

353
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,041
You really don't want me to.

354
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,446
Open the damn door!

355
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,365
Listen to me!
I'm trying to save your life.

356
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,841
The maze is one thing, but you kids
wouldn't last one day...

357
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,968
out in the Scorch.

358
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,561
If the elements don't kill you,
the Cranks will.

359
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,209
Thomas, you have to believe me.

360
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,804
I only want what's best for you.

361
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,127
Yeah, let me guess. WICKED is good?

362
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,887
You're not getting through
that door, Thomas.

363
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,451
- Hey, guys.
- Come on!

364
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,609
Thomas! Come on! Let's go!

365
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,041
Go, go. Stop him!

366
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,844
Shut the main vault door!

367
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,366
- No!
- Thomas?

368
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,284
Come on, Thomas! Come on!

369
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,208
- Move! Move!
- Thomas, what's going on?

370
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,605
- Come on.
- You little shit.

371
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,202
Come on, Thomas. Let's go. Come on!

372
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,721
Come on. Keep moving!

373
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,730
Come on. Come on!

374
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,966
Come on, come on!

375
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,406
Fan out!

376
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,363
All right, come on. Keep going!

377
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,785
Shit.

378
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,961
Come on, go! Go!
We'll lose them in the storm!

379
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,802
Notify on visual.

380
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,802
Copy that.

381
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,724
Standby, Two. Be on my six.

382
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,126
Everybody, go, go, go.
Stay low. Stay low!

383
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,449
Teresa, hang on. Stay together!

384
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,931
I think we lost them!

385
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,570
Keep going, guys. Let's go.

386
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,401
Watch out! Where are we even going?

387
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,811
- Come on, Aris. Let's go. Come on!
- Over here!

388
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,605
- Come on!
- Teresa, wait! No, don't go in there!

389
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,140
Get down here!

390
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,605
- Okay, come on!
- Get inside!

391
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,761
Come on, we should go.

392
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,081
Aris, get in!

393
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,566
Let's go, Fry.

394
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,890
Can you hold onto this?

395
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,080
Where the hell are we?

396
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,441
We gotta go.

397
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,170
- No. Thomas, stop!
- We gotta keep moving.

398
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,324
Tell me what's going on.

399
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,285
It's WICKED.

400
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,167
It's WICKED. They lied to us.
We never escaped.

401
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,289
Me and Aris, we found bodies.

402
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,323
Too many to count.

403
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,642
What do you mean? Dead bodies?

404
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,808
No, but they weren't alive either.

405
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,167
They had them strung up.

406
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,924
With tubes coming out of them.

407
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,162
They were being drained.

408
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,326
There's something inside
of us that WICKED wants.

409
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,163
Something in our blood.

410
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,963
So we have to get as far away
from them as possible.

411
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,162
Okay. So, what's the plan?

412
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,126
You do have a plan, right?

413
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,123
Yeah. I don't know.

414
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,846
Well, we followed you
out here, Thomas...

415
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,843
and now you're saying that you have
no idea where we're going...

416
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,321
or what we're doing.

417
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,044
Wait. Janson said something
about people hiding in the mountains.

418
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,567
Some kind of resistance or army.

419
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,051
The Right Arm.

420
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,841
The Right Arm. If they're really
against WICKED, maybe they can help us.

421
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,331
People. In the mountains.
Mountain people.

422
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,687
That's your plan?

423
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,925
It's the only chance we have.

424
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,161
Hey, guys.

425
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,010
Check this out.

426
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,605
Minho, give me a light!

427
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,729
Someone's been down here.

428
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,090
Come on. Open up.

429
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,966
Looks like people lived here.

430
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,844
Where are they now?

431
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,841
Let's pack some of this stuff up.

432
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,328
Anything you think you might need.

433
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,847
We'll split up, see what else we can find.
Meet back here.

434
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,171
Wait, Thomas.

435
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,027
Let's go.

436
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,641
- Thomas.
- Yeah?

437
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,961
All those kids that we
left behind back there.

438
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,164
I don't want to end up like that.

439
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,361
Hey.

440
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,682
Do you hear me?

441
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,962
Yeah, I hear you.

442
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,846
Good. Now, what are we
looking for out here?

443
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,002
Signs of life.

444
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,563
People. Survivors.
Anyone who can help us.

445
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,405
Does he count?

446
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,365
Shit.

447
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,931
They had power.

448
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,561
You all right?

449
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,766
I'm fine.

450
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,281
What?

451
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,009
Where did you go?

452
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,404
This looks promising.

453
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,401
Hey, Minho. Wait!

454
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,807
Thomas, watch out!

455
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,086
Get back, get back!

456
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,641
Jesus.

457
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,165
Her eyes!

458
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,331
Oh, shit.

459
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,162
Stay back!

460
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,569
What the hell is that thing?

461
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,326
Gotta move! Go!

462
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,327
Go!

463
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,885
- Hold it down!
- What?

464
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,850
- Hold it down!
- Minho, what are you doing?

465
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,611
Watch out! Watch out!

466
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,529
Go, go, go!

467
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,610
Let's get the hell out of here!

468
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,561
Shit.

469
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,567
What's going on?

470
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,926
I don't know.

471
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,200
Hey!

472
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,607
Hey!

473
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,268
Run!

474
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,570
Go!

475
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,006
Shit!

476
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,541
Hey!

477
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,321
- Go!
- Get outta here!

478
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,926
Run!

479
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,481
Come on!

480
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,763
Let's go, go, go!

481
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,641
Let's go!

482
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,329
Thomas, Minho,
what the hell are those things?

483
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,045
I don't know. Just keep going!

484
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,206
Move! Move!

485
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,726
Where do we go?

486
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,803
Come on, keep moving!

487
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,409
- Aris, no!
- No!

488
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,641
Go! Go around!

489
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,563
Teresa!

490
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,841
Minho, come on!

491
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,168
Come on, come on!

492
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,885
Where the hell are we gonna go?

493
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,684
We gotta find a way out of here!

494
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,326
Go!

495
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,761
Faster, faster!

496
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,206
Newt! Newt!

497
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,646
Guys, help!

498
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,247
- Newt, you good?
- Yeah. Thanks, Tommy.

499
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,004
- Come on, Newt!
- Keep going!

500
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,447
Through here, through here!
Let's go! They're coming!

501
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,481
Guys, where are we going?

502
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,161
Okay, run! Go! Go!

503
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,482
- Just keep going!
- Come on, they're coming!

504
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,760
It's a dead end!

505
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,969
Get us out of here, Thomas!

506
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,362
This one!

507
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,203
I'll hold them back!

508
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,361
Harder!

509
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,531
Get that door open!

510
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,681
Move!

511
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,530
Come on, Frypan! Let's go!

512
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,041
Come on! It's open!

513
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,486
Everyone through! Come on! Come on!

514
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,526
Winston!

515
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,885
Help me!

516
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,530
Help! Please!

517
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,487
Please! Oh, my God!

518
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,041
Go, go, go!

519
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,248
- Get up, Winston!
- Hurry!

520
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,961
- Minho, go! I'm right behind you!
- Let's go! Let's go!

521
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,081
Thomas. Get in.

522
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,410
Hey! Get out of here!

523
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,489
Are they gone?

524
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,242
Yeah, I think we're safe for now.

525
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,964
Okay, we should get moving.

526
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,804
Let's pack it up.

527
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,007
Aris, come on.

528
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,128
Fry, Winston. Let's go.

529
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,008
Hey, man.

530
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,963
You okay?

531
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,208
What the hell happened to this place?

532
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,006
I don't know.

533
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,371
It doesn't look like anyone's been here
in a long time.

534
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,771
I hope the whole world's not like this.

535
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,884
Hang on, stop.

536
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,080
Do you hear that?

537
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,811
Get down! Everybody, hide! Hide! Hide!

538
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,962
Get in here. In here, in here!

539
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,480
Oh, shit.

540
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,608
They're never gonna stop looking for us,
are they?

541
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,442
Everyone good?

542
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,771
Yeah.

543
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,131
A little further, guys.

544
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,289
Those mountains, that's gotta be it.

545
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,970
That's where we're going.

546
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,803
That's a long way off.

547
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,170
Then we better get moving.

548
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,203
Winston! Hey, Winston!

549
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,526
Winston!

550
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,681
He's hurt pretty bad.

551
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,848
What do we do?

552
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,647
Shit.

553
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,209
Winston. Can you hear me?

554
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,001
It's okay.

555
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,130
Hang in there, Winston.

556
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,922
Thomas.

557
00:46:13,022 --> 00:46:15,365
- Grab his legs.
- I got him, I got him.

558
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,125
Gotta find shelter!

559
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,886
Thanks.

560
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,049
It's like they're getting further away.

561
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,721
We just gotta keep moving.
We can make it.

562
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,560
How's it looking?

563
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,525
It's a little further.

564
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,889
That's not very convincing.

565
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,601
Hey, what's going on with you?

566
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,289
They did something to me.

567
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,926
At first it just felt like I was waking up
from a dream or something.

568
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,681
Then they all started coming back.

569
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,965
Your memories?

570
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,921
What do you remember?

571
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,806
I remember the first time
they brought you in.

572
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,124
I was taller than you then. And faster.

573
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,566
Okay.

574
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,248
And I remember why we were there.

575
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,648
We thought we could fix all this.

576
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,601
I think we should go back.

577
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,127
- What?
- Just listen to me.

578
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,886
What are you talking about? Go back?
After everything they've done to us.

579
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,087
No, it's not that simple.

580
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,446
Yeah, I think it is that simple.

581
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,841
No. You don't understand.

582
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,490
What don't I understand?

583
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,648
Everything was fine until you...

584
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,125
What?

585
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,206
Nothing.

586
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,005
Teresa, what aren't you telling me?

587
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,561
Hey! Guys, get down here!

588
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,290
Winston what are you doing, man?

589
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,169
- Give me that!
- What's going on?

590
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,446
- What happened?
- I don't know.

591
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,329
He just woke up and grabbed the gun
and then he tried to...

592
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,766
Give it back, please.

593
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,121
Winston, are you okay?

594
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,241
It's growing...

595
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,686
inside me.

596
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,324
I'm not gonna make it.

597
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,363
Please. Please.

598
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,411
Don't let me turn
into one of those things.

599
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,046
Wait, Newt...

600
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,490
Thank you.

601
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,522
Now, get outta here.

602
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,007
Good-bye, Winston.

603
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,886
Go.

604
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,567
It's okay.

605
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,325
I'm sorry.

606
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,890
Thomas.

607
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,644
Take care of them.

608
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,523
I thought we were supposed to be immune.

609
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,046
Not all of us, I guess.

610
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,000
If Winston can get infected...

611
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,567
we should assume so can the rest of us.

612
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,168
I never thought I'd say it...

613
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,086
I miss the Glade.

614
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,323
Hey. Hey.

615
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,100
Get up.

616
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,407
Newt, get up. Come on, let's go.
Frypan, Aris. I see something.

617
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,221
What is it? What...

618
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,005
You see that?

619
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,886
It's lights.

620
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,127
We made it.

621
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,521
Let's go. We gotta go. Come on.

622
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,490
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

623
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,327
- Hurry!
- Go!

624
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,001
Run!

625
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,531
Keep moving! Come on!

626
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,727
Let's go!

627
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,804
Come on, Teresa!

628
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,927
Go, go, go!

629
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,366
We're getting closer!

630
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,691
Keep going!

631
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,564
Get inside! Go!

632
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,126
Oh, shi...

633
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,446
Minho!

634
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,250
Come help him!

635
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,127
Come on, get him up.

636
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,721
Keep going!

637
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,881
Go!

638
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,806
Move! Come on! Hurry up!

639
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,883
Come on! Get in.

640
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,967
Put him down. Watch his head.

641
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,610
Who's got a light?

642
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,201
Minho!

643
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,364
- Come on, come on.
- Minho?

644
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,681
Minho?

645
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,211
Come on, Minho.

646
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,927
Come on, man.

647
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,240
There he is.

648
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,441
There you go.

649
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,887
Here you are. Are you okay?

650
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,647
What happened?

651
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,244
I think you got struck by lightning.

652
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,166
Come on, let's get him up.

653
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,731
Nice and slow.

654
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,282
Okay.

655
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,441
Let's get him up.

656
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,608
Think you can get up? Yeah?

657
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,249
Oh, my God.

658
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,127
- Thanks, guys.
- Hey.

659
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,601
What's that smell?

660
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,841
Behind you!

661
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,321
Oh, shit! Oh, my God.

662
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,370
I see you've met our guard dogs.

663
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,005
Who's that?

664
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,369
Stay back! Stay back!

665
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,369
You guys look like shit.

666
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,011
Come on. Follow me.

667
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,086
Unless you want to stay here with them.

668
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,046
Oh, my.

669
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,485
Come on, keep up.

670
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,688
Jorge wants to meet you.

671
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,046
Who's Jorge?

672
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,182
You'll see.

673
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,251
No one's come out of the Scorch
in a long time.

674
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,764
You've just got him curious.

675
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,171
And me, too.

676
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,761
Anyone else starting to get
a bad feeling about this place?

677
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,328
Let's just hear him out.
See what he has to say.

678
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,645
Jorge, they're here.

679
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,722
Quiet.

680
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,481
Damn it.

681
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,166
Do you ever get the feeling
the whole world's against you?

682
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,965
Three questions.
Where did you come from?

683
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,689
Where are you going?

684
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,804
How can I profit?

685
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,368
Don't all answer at once.

686
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,484
We're headed for the mountains.
Looking for the Right Arm.

687
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,323
You're looking for ghosts, you mean.

688
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,050
Question number two.

689
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,568
Where did you come from?

690
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,245
That's our business.

691
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,362
Hey!

692
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,851
Get the hell off me!

693
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,724
Get the hell off me, man!

694
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,725
Shut up, you big baby.

695
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,688
What is that?

696
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,291
You were right.

697
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,882
Right about what?
What is she talking about?

698
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,363
I'm sorry, hermano.

699
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,883
Looks like you're tagged.

700
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,043
You came from WICKED.

701
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,084
Which means...

702
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,720
you're very valuable.

703
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,920
Good plan, Thomas.
"Just hear what the man has to say."

704
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,810
Really working out for us.

705
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,450
Shut up, Minho.

706
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,082
Maybe I can reach the rope.

707
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,088
Enjoying the view?

708
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,482
What the hell do you want?

709
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,043
That is the question.

710
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,241
My men want to sell you back to WICKED.

711
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,089
Life has taught them to think small.
I'm not like that.

712
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,409
Something tells me
that you're not either.

713
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,167
Is the blood rushing to my head
or is this shank not making any sense?

714
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,120
Tell me what you know
about the Right Arm.

715
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,803
I thought you said they were ghosts.

716
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,122
I happen to believe in ghosts.

717
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,444
Especially when I hear them
chattering on the airwaves.

718
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,801
You tell me what you know,
and maybe we can make a deal.

719
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,965
We don't know much.

720
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,811
Okay! Okay, all right.

721
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,282
They're hiding in the mountains.

722
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,886
And they attacked WICKED.
They got out a bunch of kids.

723
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,485
That's it. That's all we know.

724
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,010
Yo, Jorge.

725
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,166
What's going on?

726
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,721
Me and my new friends
were just getting acquainted.

727
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,005
We're done now.

728
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,202
Hey, wait. You're not gonna help us?

729
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,369
Don't worry, hermano.

730
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,171
We'll get you back to where you belong.

731
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,241
Hang tight.

732
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,050
Going somewhere?

733
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,764
We both are.

734
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,844
Pack what you need. Do it quietly.

735
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,050
Where exactly are we going?

736
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,723
It's real, Bren.
These kids are our ticket.

737
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,247
The Right Arm can't turn us away.

738
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,090
Go now.

739
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,250
Okay. I got it.

740
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,845
Minho, ready?

741
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,081
Yeah.

742
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,401
Gotcha. Okay. One, two, here we go.

743
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,925
- Ready?
- Three.

744
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,609
Oh, shit.

745
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,527
In position. Send them in.

746
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,851
Come on, Minho. Push her harder!

747
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,001
Shit.

748
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,041
This is it. One...

749
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,770
two... three!

750
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,404
- Yes!
- Yes!

751
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,561
Okay.

752
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,367
Teresa, hurry!

753
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,846
So what,
you're just gonna give it all up?

754
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,081
Everything you've built?

755
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,004
There's no future here.

756
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,841
What happens when another gang
finds this place?

757
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,651
And I lose control,
and I can't protect you.

758
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,007
I don't need you to protect me.

759
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,491
What happens if you get the Flare?

760
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,483
What am I supposed to do then?

761
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,529
Chain you up, watch you turn?

762
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,570
Put a bullet in your head?
Is that what you expect of me?

763
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,366
I would do the same thing for you.

764
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,291
Good evening!

765
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,171
This is the
World Catastrophe Killzone Department.

766
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,042
We have your compound
completely surrounded.

767
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,565
You find yourselves,
through no fault of your own...

768
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,762
in possession of WICKED property.

769
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,967
Barkley.

770
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,723
Return them to us unharmed and we'll
consider this a simple misunderstanding.

771
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,380
Hang on, guys.

772
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,688
- Or you can resist...
- Newt!

773
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,923
...and every last one of you will die.

774
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,201
It won't be long before
the Flare wipes out the rest of us.

775
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,682
The hope of a cure lies in your hands.

776
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,481
The choice is yours.

777
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,530
Go get the kids.

778
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,010
What are you gonna do?

779
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,686
I'm gonna play 'em my favorite song.

780
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,331
Oh, shit.

781
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,051
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

782
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,881
We're not trying to cause any trouble, okay?
We just got to get out of here.

783
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,485
Is that so?

784
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,291
Janson, I got 'em for ya.
I'm bringing 'em down.

785
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,925
Don't shoot us.

786
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,050
Come on. Let's go.

787
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,488
I said let's go.

788
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,770
You little bastard!

789
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,284
Okay. Come on.

790
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,968
Come on! Let's go!

791
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,563
Barkley, what's your location?

792
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,291
Barkley, are you there?

793
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,482
Sir, you hearing this?

794
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,170
What is that?

795
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,170
Brenda! Hurry!

796
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,164
We don't have much time!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

797
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,330
Right this way!

798
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,364
You gotta be kidding me.

799
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,726
Plan B, hermano.

800
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,843
You kids wanna get to the Right Arm?

801
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,162
I'll lead you to them.
But you're gonna owe me.

802
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,168
Follow me!

803
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,244
All right! Let's go!

804
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,484
- Come on!
- Everyone, go.

805
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,210
Go! Come on.

806
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,521
- Come on!
- Aris, come on.

807
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,170
All units, push in!

808
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,049
They're on the top floor! Top floor!

809
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,531
We're on the move!

810
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,921
- Go!
- Go, Aris, go.

811
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,385
Teresa, you're next. Come on.

812
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,050
Brenda! Where you going?

813
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,369
Just go. I'm right behind you.

814
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,567
Hurry.

815
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,880
Alpha 22 in pursuit. We're on the move!

816
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,725
Brenda, come on. What are you doing?

817
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,087
We gotta go!

818
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,401
- I got it.
- Come on.

819
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,047
Shit.

820
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,041
Take cover!

821
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,921
Go! Go!

822
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,041
Shit!

823
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,210
Come on, hurry!
We're running out of time!

824
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,725
- On the east!
- Cut 'em off!

825
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,721
I got eyes on!

826
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,286
Here, follow me!

827
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:48,362
Come on!

828
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,922
Stop! Stay right where you are!

829
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,045
Shit.

830
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,204
No, we need them.
You go around. I'll go after them.

831
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,520
Over here. Over here.

832
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,727
Kid, don't move!

833
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,450
Brenda, where are we going?

834
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,043
Hurry! The song's almost over!

835
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,166
Holy shit!

836
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,961
Come on.

837
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,724
Thomas! Come on!

838
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,681
Are you okay?

839
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,409
Yeah, great.

840
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,724
No, no. How are we gonna
get back to the others?

841
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,121
Relax. I'm gonna get us out of here.

842
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,281
Here.

843
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,724
Why are you helping us?

844
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,722
Trust me, it's not my idea.

845
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,930
Jorge seems to think you guys
are our ticket to the safe haven.

846
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,971
The what?

847
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,566
You know, paradise.

848
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,210
Safe from the sun, free of infection.

849
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,324
Supposedly, the Right Arm's
been taking kids there for years.

850
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,731
Immunes, anyway.

851
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,004
And you know where that is?

852
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,201
No.

853
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,805
But Jorge knows a guy. Marcus.

854
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,602
He used to smuggle kids
up into the mountains.

855
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,127
If Jorge made it out,
that's where he'll be taking your friends.

856
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,691
If he made it out?

857
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,281
You ask a lot of questions.

858
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,967
Can you just come over here
and help me with this?

859
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,445
Please.

860
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,963
Well, that doesn't sound good.

861
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,721
Yeah.

862
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,161
Down here they'll be full term.

863
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,524
Let's go.

864
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,924
I think it's this way.

865
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,571
You think?

866
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,962
Do people live down here?

867
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,930
The Solar Storms
forced people underground.

868
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,882
Jorge says there's settlements
all over these tunnels.

869
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,610
So, what about Jorge? Is he your father?

870
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,171
Close enough.

871
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,207
Truth is, I don't really know what he is.
He's just always been there.

872
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,728
And I've always done what he's asked
me to do, no matter how stupid.

873
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,161
So you don't think
the Right Arm is real?

874
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,371
I think...

875
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,567
hope is a dangerous thing.

876
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:22,245
Hope has killed more of my friends
than the Flare and the Scorch combined.

877
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,771
Just thought Jorge
was smarter than that.

878
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,401
Damn.

879
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,767
Hey, I think it might be this way.

880
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,761
Brenda?

881
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,126
Brenda?

882
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,250
I'm over here. Look at this.

883
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,931
What? What is it?

884
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,322
What the hell is this?

885
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,808
I don't know.

886
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,126
Jesus.

887
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,001
Go, go, go!

888
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,965
Oh, my God!

889
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,001
Come on!

890
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,166
Keep going!

891
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,050
We're almost there. Come on.

892
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,045
Come on! This way!

893
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,086
Thomas! Come on!

894
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,641
Okay.

895
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,164
- Go, go!
- Come on!

896
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,368
Keep going!

897
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,601
Watch out!

898
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,287
Are you okay?

899
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,250
Come on!

900
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,726
Follow me!

901
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,771
Yeah, I'm behind you.

902
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,042
Go, go, go!

903
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,804
- Okay, go, go!
- Come on!

904
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:50,881
Brenda!

905
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,321
Brenda!

906
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,325
You okay?

907
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,640
Yeah.

908
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,124
Hang on, I'm gonna find a way down.

909
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,802
No, Brenda, don't move. Don't move!

910
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,120
- Come on.
- I can't.

911
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,044
Brenda, grab my hand.

912
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,891
No, no!

913
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,641
Thomas!

914
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,366
- Brenda!
- I can't reach!

915
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,767
Come on!

916
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,681
Brenda!

917
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,485
Got you.

918
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,727
We can get down here. Come on.

919
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,930
Hey, you hear that?

920
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,606
You all right?

921
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,365
Shit.

922
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,281
Brenda...

923
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,370
Yeah, yeah. I know.

924
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,041
Let's just go find Marcus.

925
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,321
Okay.

926
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,323
Try to blend in.

927
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,843
Are you sure this is the place?

928
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,524
You here for the party?

929
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,001
No.

930
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,042
We're looking for Marcus.
This is his place, isn't it?

931
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,407
This is my place.

932
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,249
Are you Marcus?

933
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,726
Marcus doesn't live here anymore.

934
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,210
Do you know where we can find him?

935
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,524
Sure, sure. He's over in Zone B.

936
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,041
Okay. What's Zone B?

937
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,248
It's where they burn the bodies.

938
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,722
Okay, look, has anyone else been
by here...

939
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,644
looking for him?

940
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,802
Group of kids around our age?
They had a girl with them.

941
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,610
Dark hair.

942
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,731
You know...
I think they might be inside.

943
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:51,761
Here.

944
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,484
Drink this.

945
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:59,730
What is it?

946
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,482
The price of admission.

947
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,721
Drink it!

948
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,566
Your turn.

949
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,525
All right.

950
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,005
You two, enjoy the party.

951
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,281
Maybe we should split up.

952
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,163
See if we can find the others.

953
01:23:58,920 --> 01:23:59,887
Hey.

954
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,288
Don't drink anything else.

955
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,570
That was fun!

956
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,582
What?

957
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,645
Brenda?

958
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,567
They're not here.

959
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:09,482
Okay, well... we should keep looking.

960
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,881
Why?

961
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,410
We couldn't find the Right Arm anyway.

962
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,567
Not without Marcus.

963
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,247
Your friends are gone.

964
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,929
It's over.

965
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,841
It's just us now.

966
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,089
Just try and relax.

967
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,685
Let go.

968
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,325
How?

969
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,765
Like this.

970
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,450
What?

971
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,483
You're not her.

972
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,161
Brenda.

973
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,006
Thomas.

974
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,801
Hey.

975
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,885
Hey. Did anyone see you come here?

976
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,320
No, what are you talking about?

977
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,686
We don't have a lot of time.

978
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:20,881
Thomas, what's wrong?

979
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,644
I just had to see you...

980
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,604
and just try to explain things before...

981
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,207
- Oh, no.
- Thomas!

982
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,658
Just listen to me, okay?
Whatever they tell you about me,

983
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:33,724
whatever they say,
I just need you to know I had to do it.

984
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,281
Okay?

985
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,290
What did you do?

986
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,726
I just couldn't keep watching them die.

987
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,802
Over here! Come on.

988
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,171
- No!
- I'm sorry.

989
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,322
Thomas!

990
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,522
Hey, you're okay.

991
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,381
Hi.

992
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,121
We have to stop meeting like this.

993
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,364
Welcome back, you ugly shank.

994
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:10,811
I suggest that you talk!
You son of a bitch!

995
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,377
Damn it!

996
01:28:13,477 --> 01:28:16,886
I'm sorry, you're going
to have to leave my house.

997
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,768
Looks like you've been having fun.

998
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:23,369
Listen. I don't enjoy hurting you.

999
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,446
Okay?

1000
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,482
Where is the Right Arm, Marcus?

1001
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,724
Wait, this is Marcus?

1002
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,969
The kid catches on quick.

1003
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,686
Are you the brains of the operation?

1004
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,851
I know you know where they're hiding.

1005
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:44,689
So you tell me,
and I'll make you a deal.

1006
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,368
You can come with us.

1007
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,046
I burned that bridge a long time ago.

1008
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,962
Besides, I made my own deal.

1009
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:59,204
You're the one who taught me,
never miss an opportunity.

1010
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,765
What's he talking about?

1011
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:07,722
I'm talking about supply and demand.

1012
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,601
WICKED wants all the Immunes
they can get.

1013
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,965
I help provide that for them.

1014
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,922
So I lure the kids in...

1015
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,690
they get drunk, they have a good time.

1016
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,128
And then, later, WICKED comes in...

1017
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:25,363
they separate the wheat from the chaff.

1018
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,445
I changed my mind, hermano.

1019
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,803
I do enjoy hurting you.

1020
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,162
Talk! Talk!

1021
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,845
Okay! Jesus!

1022
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,923
But I'm not making any promises.

1023
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,367
These guys like to move around.

1024
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,408
They have an outpost in the mountains.

1025
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,729
But it's a long way away.

1026
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,210
You got half of WICKED on your ass.
You're never gonna make it.

1027
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,650
Not on foot.

1028
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,050
Where's Bertha?

1029
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,530
Not Bertha.

1030
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,804
Well, I guess we're on foot.

1031
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,847
- Get down!
- Take cover!

1032
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,568
Hey, is everyone okay out there?

1033
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,846
We're fine.

1034
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,247
Anyone know where
those bloody shots came from?

1035
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,047
That son of a bitch, Marcus.
He led us into an ambush.

1036
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,450
What do we do?

1037
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:25,801
Here.

1038
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,530
Hold this.

1039
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,887
We gotta create a diversion.

1040
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,485
You get ready to chuck it.

1041
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,049
Everybody!

1042
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,565
Get set to sprint back to the truck!

1043
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,324
And hold your ears!

1044
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,883
Ready? One...

1045
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,201
Two...

1046
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,801
Drop it.

1047
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,321
Now!

1048
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:56,322
I said drop it!

1049
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,889
On your feet. Let's go.

1050
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:06,411
Let's go! Move!

1051
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,250
- Back up!
- Easy.

1052
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,161
You two, over here now!

1053
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,926
- Come on, let's go!
- Don't be stupid! Move.

1054
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,851
Slowly.

1055
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:20,847
Aris?

1056
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,520
Oh, my God. Harriet?

1057
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,887
My God.
What the hell are you doing here?

1058
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,682
Sonya.

1059
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,127
Aris, you're lucky we didn't
shoot your dumb ass.

1060
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,211
You all right, man?

1061
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,361
How...?

1062
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:39,885
What's happening?

1063
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:41,884
We were in the maze together.

1064
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,566
We're clear, guys! Come on out!

1065
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,370
Copy that! We're clear!

1066
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,210
Stand down!

1067
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,448
My God, you're alive.

1068
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:05,926
Back it up, Joe!

1069
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,411
Back it up!

1070
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,564
We're taking them to base.

1071
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,405
Wait, so, how did you guys get here?

1072
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,163
- The Right Arm got us out.
- Wait.

1073
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,404
The Right Arm?
Do you know where they are?

1074
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:28,921
Hop in.

1075
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,202
They've been planning this
for over a year now.

1076
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,690
This is all for us.

1077
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,683
You guys are lucky you found us
when you did.

1078
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,842
We're moving out at first light.

1079
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,490
- Where's Vince?
- Somewhere over there, I think.

1080
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,566
Who's Vince?

1081
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:26,361
He's the one who decides
if you get to stay.

1082
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,368
I thought the Right Arm
was supposed to be an army.

1083
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,409
Yeah, we were.

1084
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,728
This is all that's left of us.

1085
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,646
Lot of good people died
getting us this far.

1086
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,846
Who are they?

1087
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,570
They're Immunes.

1088
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,683
Caught 'em coming up the mountain.

1089
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,845
Did you check 'em?

1090
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,162
I know this guy, Aris. I trust him.

1091
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,844
Well, I don't. Check 'em.

1092
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,771
Hey, boss...

1093
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,164
Brenda! Brenda!

1094
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,370
What's going on?

1095
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,409
Brenda! Brenda.

1096
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,848
- Brenda, talk to me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1097
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,206
What's going on with her?

1098
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,522
I don't know. Brenda, are you all right?

1099
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:19,045
- Brenda? Talk to me.
- What the hell?

1100
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,722
Shit!

1101
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,126
- Crank! We got a Crank!
- No!

1102
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,770
- No!
- Wait, wait!

1103
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,530
- Step back!
- Listen, okay?

1104
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,523
This just happened, okay?
She's not dangerous yet.

1105
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,882
- You shouldn't have brought her here!
- I know.

1106
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,123
We let Cranks in here now,
the safe haven doesn't last a week!

1107
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:35,571
- Step back!
- I understand, okay? I understand.

1108
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,202
Just listen. Please. Please, okay?
I told her that you could help.

1109
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,764
Okay? No.

1110
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,964
There's got to be something you can do.

1111
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:49,326
Yeah, there is.

1112
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:56,128
- I can put her out of her misery.
- No! No!

1113
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,886
Vince, that's enough! Let him go.

1114
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,325
Let him go!

1115
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,970
She's infected, Doc.
There's nothing we can do for her.

1116
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,566
No, but he can.

1117
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:12,810
Hello, Thomas.

1118
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,287
What?

1119
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,924
You know me?

1120
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,441
Interesting.

1121
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,641
It makes sense
they'd put you in the maze.

1122
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,330
Though I must admit...

1123
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,485
I was worried they'd kill you
after what you did.

1124
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:35,805
What I did?

1125
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,600
The first time we spoke,
you said you couldn't take it anymore...

1126
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,521
watching your friends die, one by one.

1127
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,849
The last time we spoke...

1128
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,800
you gave me the coordinates
of every WICKED compound, trial and lab.

1129
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,964
He was our source.

1130
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:00,886
We couldn't have pulled
all this off without him.

1131
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,845
Take her to the tent.

1132
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,482
Get these guys some warm clothes.

1133
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,165
- Careful.
- Come on.

1134
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,206
Hey, it's the least we can do.

1135
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,808
Thomas, come on.

1136
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,323
I need to get some blood from you.

1137
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,926
In the beginning, we were lost.

1138
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,167
All we knew for sure...

1139
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,722
was that the younger you were,
the stronger your chances.

1140
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,210
You worked for WICKED?

1141
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,688
Long time ago.

1142
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,681
You know, at first,
we had the best intentions.

1143
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,681
Find a cure, save the world.

1144
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,686
It was clear you kids were the key,
because you were immune.

1145
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:59,851
But why?

1146
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,288
Eventually, we found an answer.

1147
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:05,525
An enzyme produced
by the brains of the immune.

1148
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:07,091
Once separated from the bloodstream...

1149
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:10,687
it can serve as a powerful agent
to slow the spread of the virus.

1150
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,927
So, you found a cure?

1151
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,805
Not exactly.

1152
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:21,609
The enzyme can't be manufactured,
only harvested from the immune.

1153
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,600
The young.

1154
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,727
Of course, that didn't stop WICKED.

1155
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,927
If they had their way...

1156
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,970
they'd sacrifice an entire generation.

1157
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,805
All for this.

1158
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,251
A gift of biology.

1159
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,084
Of evolution.

1160
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,087
But one not meant for all of us.

1161
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,130
How long will that give her?

1162
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,851
It's different for everyone.
A few months maybe.

1163
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,242
But that's the catch, isn't it?

1164
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,845
She'll always need more.

1165
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:13,966
Okay.

1166
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:17,046
Let's go outside. Let them rest.

1167
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:18,761
Let's go.

1168
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:21,925
She'll be fine.

1169
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,862
Thomas.

1170
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,564
You know she can't come with us, right?

1171
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,890
He was my brother.

1172
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,568
Hey. Sorry.

1173
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:41,722
Are you okay? How are you feeling?

1174
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,488
You remind me of him.

1175
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,691
He always saw the best in people.

1176
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,090
Where is he now?

1177
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,249
I don't know.

1178
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,168
When we were kids...

1179
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:12,085
we were taken in
by one of WICKED's camps.

1180
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,568
They gave us a bunch of tests.

1181
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,049
They didn't want me.

1182
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,250
They wanted him, though.

1183
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:34,163
They didn't even let me say good-bye.

1184
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,524
What was his name?

1185
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,249
George.

1186
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:05,571
That was Chuck.

1187
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,361
How did he die?

1188
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,130
Saving my life.

1189
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:36,971
Get some rest.

1190
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,130
Hermano.

1191
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,323
If anything were to happen to her, I...

1192
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:55,482
I know, I know.

1193
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,843
You should get in there. Go talk to her.

1194
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,203
I guess I owe you, now.

1195
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,043
So we broke out. I'm telling the truth.

1196
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,648
I wish Alby could've seen all this.

1197
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,965
And Winston.

1198
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:41,286
And Chuck.

1199
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,928
He'd be proud of you, you know, Tommy.

1200
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,246
Yeah.

1201
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:53,211
Hey, Aris!

1202
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,531
Hey, guys!

1203
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:58,364
I kinda like that kid.

1204
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,809
Yeah. I still don't trust him, though.

1205
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,448
Hey, where's Teresa?

1206
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,170
She went up there.

1207
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,401
Hey, you okay?

1208
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,767
What are you doing up here?

1209
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:37,930
Just thinking.

1210
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,730
All right, I'll let you be alone.

1211
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,203
Do you remember your mother?

1212
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:58,931
I think so.

1213
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,570
I remember mine.

1214
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,122
She was a beautiful woman.

1215
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,609
Everybody loved her.

1216
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,441
And before WICKED, she was all I had.

1217
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,689
When she got sick,
I didn't know what to do.

1218
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:27,324
I just kept her locked up. Hidden.

1219
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,523
I thought she'd get better.

1220
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,807
Every night, she'd make
these awful sounds, like screaming.

1221
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,322
And then, one night, she just stopped.

1222
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,330
She was finally quiet.

1223
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,004
I went down to her room.

1224
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,564
And there was blood everywhere.

1225
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:58,122
But she was just sat there, calm.

1226
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,850
She said she was feeling better.

1227
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,491
The visions were gone.
She'd taken care of them.

1228
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,884
She took her eyes out, Thomas.

1229
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,361
There are millions of people
suffering out there.

1230
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,966
Millions of stories, just like mine.

1231
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,161
We can't turn our backs on them.

1232
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,925
I won't.

1233
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:33,571
What are you saying?

1234
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,691
I'm saying, I want you to understand.

1235
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,050
Understand what?

1236
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,291
Why I did it.

1237
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,126
Teresa...

1238
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,962
Please don't fight them, Thomas.

1239
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,771
What have you done?

1240
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:06,929
What have you done?

1241
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,289
No!

1242
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,485
All right, drop in, boys. Round 'em up.

1243
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,051
Go, go!

1244
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,281
Take 'em out!

1245
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,440
Tyson!

1246
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,084
- Stop!
- Don't move!

1247
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,011
Where's Thomas?

1248
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,648
Harriet! Ammo!

1249
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:30,486
Vince! Harriet!

1250
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,085
- Come on!
- Over here!

1251
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:35,089
- How can we help?
- You need to cover us!

1252
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,291
Ammo!

1253
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:40,047
Hey! Do you know how to use this thing?

1254
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,201
Cover me!

1255
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,169
This fifty's our only chance!

1256
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,201
Brenda!

1257
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,882
- You dumbass.
- Come on!

1258
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,768
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1259
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:10,282
We gotta take cover!

1260
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,727
We have to go.
Now, while we still have the chance.

1261
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:16,686
- I gotta go find the others.
- No! Look! Look.

1262
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,769
You can't help them.

1263
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,949
Vince, hurry up!
There's too many of them.

1264
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,829
I'm out!

1265
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,642
- Look out!
- Shit!

1266
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,720
All right, take me down.

1267
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:53,402
Shit. Shit.

1268
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,245
I'm sorry.

1269
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,410
There's just nothing
you can do for them.

1270
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:03,610
If we don't move now,
we won't be much better off.

1271
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,402
- You guys gotta go right now.
- What?

1272
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,171
They're not looking for you.
You'll be safe, but you have to go now.

1273
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:13,926
Thomas...

1274
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,489
I can't leave without them.

1275
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:24,281
Go.

1276
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,611
Good luck, kid.

1277
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:31,968
Bren, we have to go. Come on. Come on.

1278
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,364
Let's go, come on. Come on!

1279
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:02,827
Let's go, let's go!

1280
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,048
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1281
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:17,886
Line them up right here! On their knees!
Put some eyes up on that ridge.

1282
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:20,926
B-4.

1283
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,481
How many did we get?

1284
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:25,244
All of them. Give or take.

1285
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,447
Give or take what?

1286
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:28,170
Well, they lost a few.

1287
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,171
A-4.

1288
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:36,161
A-6.

1289
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,161
B-3.

1290
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,764
Where's Thomas?

1291
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,649
Right here.

1292
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:48,686
Freeze!

1293
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,269
Go!

1294
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,641
Thomas.

1295
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,965
Get him in line.

1296
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:11,367
Okay.

1297
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,360
Bring her in.

1298
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:20,724
Why didn't you run?

1299
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,409
I'm tired of running.

1300
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:26,241
Is this all of them?

1301
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:27,890
Most of them.

1302
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:29,801
It'll be enough.

1303
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,361
Start loading them in.

1304
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:32,681
Yes, ma'am.

1305
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,120
Okay, you heard. Let's go!

1306
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,361
Get 'em on!

1307
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,804
Hello, Thomas.

1308
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,288
I'm glad you're safe.

1309
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:58,241
What the hell?

1310
01:54:58,800 --> 01:54:59,801
Teresa?

1311
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:01,770
Wait, what's going on?

1312
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,561
She's with them.

1313
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:06,801
Since when?

1314
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:11,244
Teresa's always had an evolved
appreciation of the greater good.

1315
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:16,167
Once we restored her memories,
it was only a matter of time.

1316
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:21,121
Let's go, let's go.

1317
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,611
I'm sorry.

1318
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:26,963
I had no choice. This is the only way.

1319
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:29,441
We have to find a cure.

1320
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:32,843
She's right.
This is all just a means to an end.

1321
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,968
You used to understand that, Thomas.

1322
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,329
No matter what you think of me...

1323
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:39,448
I am not a monster. I'm a doctor.

1324
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:42,206
I swore an oath to find a cure!

1325
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,046
No matter the cost.

1326
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,047
I just need more time.

1327
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,484
More blood.

1328
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,365
Hello, Mary.

1329
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,888
I hoped we'd meet again.

1330
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,042
I'm sorry it had to be
under these circumstances.

1331
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:06,890
I'm sorry about a lot of things, too.
But not this.

1332
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:10,641
At least my conscience is clear.

1333
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,404
So is mine.

1334
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,568
Mary? Mary? Mary!

1335
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,887
Mary! Mary!

1336
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,245
Get off me!

1337
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:31,408
Mary? Mary? Mary?

1338
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,486
Mary?

1339
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,766
No!

1340
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,327
Mary! No!

1341
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,566
Come on, Janson.

1342
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:44,524
Load them up. Let's go.

1343
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:47,166
All these people. Get rid of them.

1344
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:48,765
Let's go. Let's go!

1345
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:51,041
- Let go of me!
- Sonya! Aris!

1346
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:55,601
Get back! Everyone, stand back!

1347
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:58,003
- Stand back!
- Hold your fire!

1348
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,525
- Everyone, stand back!
- Hold your fire!

1349
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:02,366
- Stand back. Let 'em go.
- Thomas, put it down.

1350
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,648
- Let 'em all go!
- You know I can't do that!

1351
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,290
Thomas, please stop.

1352
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:09,967
I made a deal with them.
They promised we'd be safe. All of us.

1353
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:11,531
And I'm supposed to trust you now?

1354
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:13,762
It's true. It was her only condition.

1355
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,041
Shut up!

1356
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,442
Everything can go back
to the way it was.

1357
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:19,361
Thomas...

1358
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:21,850
do you really want all of them to die?

1359
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:26,011
Listen to her, Thomas.
Think about what you're doing.

1360
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:37,728
We're with you, Thomas.

1361
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,806
No.

1362
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:41,521
Don't.

1363
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,650
- Do it, Thomas.
- We're ready.

1364
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:48,361
- We're not going back there.
- Thomas?

1365
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:50,804
It's the only way.

1366
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,007
Thomas!

1367
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:18,042
- Come on. Come on!
- Get her out of here!

1368
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:20,580
You good?

1369
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,569
Freeze! Drop it, kid!

1370
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:26,210
Run! Get down!

1371
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:37,526
Freeze!

1372
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:48,006
What a waste.

1373
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:05,882
Vince, go!

1374
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,326
Now!

1375
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:22,731
Keep going. I got you.

1376
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:32,887
Get outta here! Go! Go!

1377
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,845
Come on, Thomas! Get outta here!

1378
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,001
Minho, let's go!

1379
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:38,321
Get out of here! Go!

1380
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:40,921
Get down!

1381
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:48,882
Minho!

1382
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:54,769
Minho!

1383
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,927
- Thomas, get back!
- No! Thomas, no!

1384
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:02,668
Minho!

1385
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,403
Thomas!

1386
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:08,801
Minho!

1387
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:10,885
Go! Come on!

1388
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,247
Minho!

1389
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,569
What do we do now?

1390
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:43,087
Well, we pick up what's left of us.

1391
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:45,441
We stick to the plan.

1392
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:47,762
We get you kids to the safe haven.

1393
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:58,841
Then we start over, I guess.

1394
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:08,444
I'm not going with you.

1395
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:12,481
What?

1396
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:16,321
I made a promise to Minho.

1397
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,008
I wouldn't leave him behind.
I have to go after him.

1398
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:23,370
Hey, kid, look around you.

1399
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:26,040
All right? WICKED just kicked our ass.

1400
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:30,647
You think about where you're headed.

1401
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:33,811
I'm not asking anyone to come with me.

1402
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,485
Thomas, listen to me.

1403
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:42,565
I've known Minho for...
Well, as long as I can remember.

1404
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:46,600
So, if there was any way
that we could help him...

1405
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:49,445
trust me, I would be up
there standing next to you.

1406
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:51,841
This, what you're talking about...

1407
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:54,284
is impossible.

1408
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:57,962
More like suicide.

1409
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,126
Maybe.

1410
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:05,721
But I know what I'm supposed to do now.

1411
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:12,125
It's not just about Minho.
It's about all of us.

1412
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:15,722
It's about everyone WICKED's ever taken,
everyone they will take.

1413
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:19,051
They'll never stop.

1414
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:25,483
They'll never stop,
so I'm gonna stop them.

1415
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,685
I'm gonna kill Ava Paige.

1416
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:37,165
I have to admit...

1417
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:41,402
I'd like some revenge.

1418
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:48,921
Well, that's a good speech, kid.

1419
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:52,404
So, what's your plan?

1420
02:03:53,305 --> 02:03:59,370
